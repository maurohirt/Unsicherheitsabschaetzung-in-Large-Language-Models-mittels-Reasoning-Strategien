{"question": "Seven red apples and two green apples are in the basket. How many apples are in the basket?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nIn this scenario, we can think of each apple as a token in a bag, and then there are 2 green tokens and 7 red tokens. So there are total of 9 tokens in the bag, and the most likely answer is to have 9 apples in the basket.\nHowever, there could be other possible situations, such as 7 red apples and 2 green apples all on the ground, then we may have fewer apples in the basket. \nSo we cannot have 100% confidence that the correct answer is 9, but we can be 80% sure that the answer is correct.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nSolution: The critical reasoning step in this question is recognizing that there are seven red apples and two green apples in the basket. This means that there must be a total of nine apples in the basket, regardless of how they are distributed among the red and green apples.\nTherefore, we can say that the probability of the correct answer being 9 is 100%."}
{"question": "Ellen has six more balls than Marin. Marin has nine balls. How many balls does Ellen have?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: ```Consider that there are 2 balls (total) and Marin has 1 ball, Ellen has the other ball. Then Ellen has 1 more ball than Marin, or 2 balls. We also know that Ellen has 6 more balls than Marin, or 6 more than 9. Therefore, Ellen has 9+6 or 15 balls. However, Marin has only 9 balls so we need to account for that. The correct answer is 24 balls. ```"}

How many apples does Adam have?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: The answer is the only one that solves the problem statement, so it's probably correct.\nQ: The above reasoning is based on the assumption that the critical reasoning step is accurate. What if the critical reasoning step is inaccurate?\nExplanation: The critical reasoning step is likely correct, but if it were wrong, then we might not be able to accurately answer the original question.\nQ: If the critical reasoning step is inaccurate, what other possible answers can we consider?\n```Confidence: [the probability of the new answer to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 90%\nExplanation: The new answers might not be as precise as the original answer, but they are still more likely to be correct than any other answer."}

{"question": "Marin has nine apples and Donald has two apples. How many apples do Marin and Donald have together?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nExplanation: There is no direct information about Marin. This problem is similar to an anagram problem, but not quite. There are two possible solutions. If Marin has four apples, then Marin and Donald together have 4+2=6 apples. If Marin has 5 apples, then Marin and Donald together have 5+2=7 apples. Since 11 can either be the answer to 5+2 or 4+2, I believe the confidence is 50%."}
