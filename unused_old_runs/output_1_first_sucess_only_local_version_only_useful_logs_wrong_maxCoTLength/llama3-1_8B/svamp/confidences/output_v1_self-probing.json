How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "78", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\nExplanation: The possible answer 78 is correct with 30% of confidence. It is most likely the correct answer because 28 children were riding on the bus, at the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus, and then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. It can be concluded that 30 children were on the bus before the bus stop, 30 children were on the bus after the bus stop, and 80 - 30 - 28 = 22 children got on the bus at the bus stop. Therefore, the number of children that got on the bus than got off the bus is 82 - 2 = 80.

My answer is 15 because Julia played tag with a total of 26 kids (12 on Monday, 14 on Tuesday), and she spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. So we can use 26/34 = 1.76 kids per hour. If you were to say the 26 kids were split evenly between Monday and Tuesday, it would be 13 kids per day on average. But the 14 kids played on Tuesday was greater than 13, so she must have had more than 13 kids on Monday as well. So 13 + 14 is 27 kids, which is greater than 26, so Julia must have had 14 kids on Monday. 14 + 14 = 28, so Julia had 15 kids total.\nAnswer: Julia played tag with 28 kids, and my confidence is 75%.

How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?", "correct answer": 60.0, "llm answer": "2 children", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nMy reasoning:\nIt is important to remember that there is a specific difference in total number of children (start point is 22, end point is 40) and also an absolute number of children (start point is 40 and end point is 62). The difference of 62 – 40 = 22 is a specific number. The 40 children at the end of the bus ride includes all 22 original children plus 18 other children. The question asks us about the 2 children (the absolute number) that were originally on the bus, and therefore we do not need to consider the other 18 children in this question.\nWe are told that at the end of the bus ride there were 2 children on the bus. If we subtract 22 from 40, we arrive at the conclusion that 2 children got off the bus. We can arrive at the conclusion in a different way. 2 out of 22 children got on the bus, therefore 20 out of 22 children did not get on the bus.

How many more bottles than apple did they have?", "correct answer": 98.0, "llm answer": "98", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: ```Let a be the number of apples. Let d be the number of diet soda. Let r be the number of regular soda. The total is 36 + 80 + 54 = 170, so 170 - a = r + d. We want to know the value of (r - a). r = 170 - a - d = 170 - a - (170 - a) = 2a - 170. Therefore, we are trying to find the value of (2a - 170 - a) = a - 170. The answer is (a - 170). The critical reasoning step above is to determine the value of a. There were 36 apples, so a = 36. Therefore, the value of a - 170 is -134.

{"question": "Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day. How many days would the soda bottles last?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "43 days", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation: The question asks you to determine Debby's supply of soda bottles that she bought on sale for a certain number of days given her consumption rate of water bottles. You know how many water bottles she consumed, which is equal to 162/122. You know how many bottles were left (360-122=238). To find the total number of bottles she consumed, we have to multiply the number of bottles consumed by water by the number of water bottles on sale (162x162=26244). We know that this equals to Debby's soda bottle supply because she bought 162 water bottles and 360 soda bottles when they were on sale. The number of soda bottles she drank is 9, so to find how many days Debby would have had to drink a soda bottle each day, divide 26244 by 9, which equals 2916 days. Since she only bought 360 soda bottles, that would be 360/2916=0.123 of a soda bottle per day. To find how many days Debby would have had to drink a soda bottle each day, multiply 0.123 by 360 to get 43.8."}

{"question": "Baker made 144 cakes. He sold 71 of them. Then he made 111 more cakes. How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?", "correct answer": 184.0, "llm answer": "73", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\nThe critical reasoning step is to count the cakes that are not sold by subtracting the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made (144 cakes made - 71 cakes sold = 73 cakes not sold). This step is crucial to solving the problem because it determines how many cakes the baker had left after selling the first set of cakes. By knowing the number of cakes not sold, we can compare it to the number of cakes made in the second set (111 cakes made) to determine the net increase in cakes made by the baker. Since 73 cakes were not sold, the correct answer should be the same number, indicating that the baker made 73 more cakes than those he sold.\nThis is why 73 is the correct answer."}

(4 cookies or 4 cakes can be purchased for the cost of 1 cake pack or 1 cookie pack). Therefore, $56 must be divisible by 4. $14 is the only multiple of $4 that is less than $56, so the most likely price is $14, which means the most likely answer is 14 packs. In addition, the total amount of change $56 is not divisible by any number greater than 4, which means that the second most likely total cost would be $28, and the second most likely number of packs would be 7. If we consider the problem in reverse order, we can also solve the problem. The most likely answer would be the total amount of change if it is divisible by both $3 (the price of a cake pack) and $1 (the price of a cookie pack). Only $28 meets this criterion.

In contrast, when we think of a concept, we usually think of the concept's definition, attributes, and relations to other concepts. For example, if someone were to say the word \"water,\" we would think of its definition, properties (such as being wet and liquid), and relations (such as being a liquid like coffee and tea). Now, we often find that some concepts seem to be of a more fundamental nature than others. For example, it is often considered fundamental to think of the color red as being a basic color, while thinking of purple as a combination of red and blue is often considered to be less fundamental. This suggests that some concepts are more fundamental than others. In some sense, the most fundamental concepts are those that are the most basic and the most"}

{"question": "Debby drinks 6 bottles a day. If she bought a total of 12 water bottles. How many days would they last her?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis is a case of simple division. There are 12 bottles of water and she drinks 6 bottles a day so it would take 12 / 6 = 2 days. However, given the context of the question, it would make more sense that she would drink the full 12 bottles in 1 day.\n\nReasoning:\n\n```The question says \"total\" bottles. We know she bought 12, which could mean she bought 6 bottles at a time over 2 days or all of them at once. Either way, she could drink 12 bottles in 2 days and would have 12/6=2 left over. If she drank 6 bottles per day, the next day would be the last day she would have left over bottles. 12/6 = 2. 2/2 = 1. If she drinks 6 bottles in 2 days, she would need 1 more day. The answer would be 2 days. However, if she drinks all 12 bottles at once, she would need only 1 day.```\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf we want to use the reasoning step to solve the problem, we can first convert the units of the number of"}

Each set has 14 chairs. That makes a total of 126 chairs and 9 tables. There are 117 more chairs than tables.\nThe reason the above answer is so likely is that most people know that there are 9 sets of tables and there are 14 chairs for each set. The most common reasoning mistake to this question is that people only look at 9 times 14, making a total of 126 chairs. This is the correct reasoning step. However, people also need to compute the number of tables. Since there are 9 sets of tables, and each set of tables has 14 chairs, the total number of tables is 9. Therefore, the total number of tables and chairs is 126 + 9 = 135. The difference between the number of chairs and the number of tables is 126 - 9 = 117.\nPlease note that for this problem, the key to the right answer is the fact that the number of chairs per set of tables is known.

You should exclude other answers that you reason out to be less probable.\nReason: As we know that Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish, the total number of fish at the start of the experiment is 16 + 71 = 87. Paige mentioned that 71 fish was eaten by the stray cats and the total number of fish at the end of the experiment is 2.\nTherefore, 87 - 71 = 16 goldfish disappeared.```"}

It can also be called a change in stock. If the difference is zero, it means the total number of cakes has not changed. It also means that the baker did not increase or decrease the total number of cakes he had. The baker has bought 139 new cakes. So, there is an increase of 139 cakes in stock. Hence, the number of cakes sold must be 139 + 145 = 284.\nExplanation: The number of cakes sold must be 145. As the baker sold 145 cakes, there is a decrease of 145 cakes in the stock. It means that the baker has a decreased stock of 145 cakes. Hence, the total stock must be less than or equal to 145.\nExplanation: The number of cakes sold must be greater than or equal to 145. As the baker sold 145 cakes, there is a decrease of 145 cakes in the stock. It means that the baker has a decreased stock of 145 cakes.

That means that we can divide the total number of erasers (4950) by the number of skittles (3941) and the remainder is 0. That means that if each skittle had exactly 10 erasers, you could evenly distribute all 4950 erasers among the 3941 skittles.\nSo, the 0 remainder means the 10 erasers answer is correct.\nThe way to think about this question is whether it is possible to have a remainder of 0 when dividing 4950 by 3941. You can always divide the total number of erasers by the total number of skittles. If you don't have a remainder of 0, then you have more erasers than skittles. That is impossible.

{"question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop sells each t-shirt for $ 51 dollars. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt and sold 130 t-shirts. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?", "correct answer": 5590.0, "llm answer": "$ 1,920", "confidence": 0.155, "probing response": "15.5%\nPossible Explanation: In order to determine the possible answer, the first step is to determine the revenue of the shop. Since the shop offered a discount of $ 8 per t-shirt, the amount of money received by the shop for each t-shirt is 51 - 8 = $ 43. This is the per unit cost to the shop. Therefore, the total revenue for the shop is 130 x 43 = $ 5,610. Subtracting this total revenue from the initial total revenue of 6,630 gives a profit of 6,630 - 5,610 = $ 1,020.

Hence, the answer cannot be 10. Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, so Jake can have 17, 18, or 19 peaches. However, if Jake has 19 peaches, he will have 10 fewer than Steven, not 7 fewer. Hence, the answer cannot be 19. With this reasoning, I can confidently answer 10% as the probability of answer 18 peaches to be correct.\nNote: There are multiple ways to answer, you can choose the one that makes sense to you the most.\nSource: Reasoning in Intelligence Analysis – 10 Things to Keep in Mind"}

How many crunches did David do?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "77", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: The most likely answer is 77, because we subtracted 13 from 17 and then added 29 to the result, thus 77. The most critical reasoning step here is: Zachary did 17 crunches. 29 more push-ups and 13 less crunches than Zachary means that David did 29 more push-ups but 13 fewer crunches than Zachary. Since Zachary did 17 crunches, then David must do 17 – 13 = 4 fewer crunches than Zachary. Therefore, the total number of crunches performed by David is 17 – 13 = 4. Adding 29 push-ups to this result yields 29 + 4 = 33. Therefore, the total number of push-ups performed by David is 29 + 4 = 33. The answer is 77 because 33 is 29 more push-ups and 4 is 13 fewer crunches than 17. Therefore, the answer is 77, because 77 = 29 + 4.\nQ: The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Identify the number of crunches done by Zachary. He did 17 crunches.

Let's just assume answer 16 wrappers more than bottle caps is correct. We can get 80% of confidence if we follow this rule: For any given set, if the amount of data is much larger than number of data class, it is highly possible the probability distribution of the whole set is like one of the classes (class, i.e., the amount of data in a class, should be larger than 20% of the whole set size). And here we can calculate the class size as (62/10/43)/10=0.14, much larger than 0.2.\nBut as we can see, for answer 16 wrappers more than bottle caps, the amount of data is 62+10, the class size is (43+10)/62/43/62=0.19, not 0.14.

If the total number of books is divisible by the number of bookshelves, the number of books in each bookshelf must be an integer, therefore it must be 17. Therefore the possibility of 17 to be the correct answer is 100% while the possibility of all other answers being the correct answer is 0%, thus, the possibility of 17 to be the correct answer is 100%/(100%+0%)=100%/100%=100%. Since the question requires the probability of 17 to be correct, the answer is 100%.

In case the answer is 9, it should be because the question requires us to consider how many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop. For this to happen, we must have subtracted 10 - 2 = 8 from the number of children after the bus stop. However, we are not told the exact number of children after the bus stop. Thus, the number of children after the bus stop may be anywhere from 8 to 17. In each of these cases, 8 is the number of more children that are on the bus after the bus stop.\nAnother Reasoning:\nWhen the bus stop is considered, the question explicitly asks for the number of children on the bus now that is more than the number before the bus stop. As there were only two children on the bus before the bus stop and there are ten children on the bus now, the answer is either 8 or 9. Because there was only one additional bus stop, there is no way for the number of children on the bus now to"}

How many planks does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nIn this problem, the critical reasoning step is identifying the correct equation to get the total number of nails needed for the house wall, which is the amount of planks of wood times the number of nails needed for each plank. Then the reasoning is using this equation to get the answer. We may have to make some assumptions in order to calculate the result for the equation. We may assume that the size of all the planks of wood are the same and we may assume that all the nails are the same.\nGiven that the critical reasoning step is correct, it is possible to answer the problem, so it is likely the answer is correct. However, it is also possible that the answer is not correct because of the assumptions we have made. The answer might not be correct if the number of nails needed for each plank is not consistent, if some of the planks of wood have different sizes, or if we have incorrectly used the equation to solve the problem. So we can say that the answer is correct with a 60% probability.\n```Answer: [answer 8, the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]```\nAnswer: 8\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the answer: Determine the total number of nails needed"}

How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest?", "correct answer": 153.0, "llm answer": "153", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```Explanation: Since we know the number of discarded sacks per day, and we know the total number of days, we can calculate the total number of discarded sacks, which will be 3,711. Subtracting the total number of discarded sacks from the total number of harvested sacks gives us 153. The reason I know this is the best answer is because we know that the number of oranges after 51 days is the same as the number of oranges after one day times 51 days, minus the total number of discarded sacks.```\nQ: What is the expected value (EV) of a bet where the payout is the same as your loss, and you are 99% certain to win?

Jerry had 3 more books than action figures. So 3 is ruled out.\nI think the answer is 2. Please tell me if I’m right. Thank you very much.\nA: I am not sure how you eliminated 4 as an answer, because the statement says Jerry added 2 action figures to the shelf. If Jerry had 3 more books than action figures, then that means the total number of books were 5 books + 2 new action figures = 7 books. Which means Jerry had 3 action figures in the first place (7 - 5). The question asked how many more books than action figures were on his shelf, and since the shelf has 5 books and 3 action figures at the beginning (5 - 3), and Jerry added 2 more action figures (5 - 3 = 2), the answer must be 2 more books than action figures were on his shelf.\nQ: The answer key is saying 4.

{"question": "Matthew gave 6 crackers to each his friends. If he had 36 crackers. How many friends did he give crackers to?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nThis problem tests our ability to divide two numbers and use the answer to solve a problem. For this problem, the critical step of reasoning to the possible answer was computing the number of friends Matthew gave crackers to. To do this, we need to divide the number of crackers (36) by the number of crackers given to each friend (6) to get 6 friends.\nTo test our confidence in the answer, we can try a different approach. First, let us make a guess that the answer is 3. Using this information, we know that Matthew had 6 crackers left over. Since each friend got 6 crackers, this means that there were 6×6−36=6×6−36=36 crackers. But we are given that Matthew had 36 crackers, so 36 is not a possible number of friends. Hence, we can be 100% confident that the answer is not 3. Similarly, we can guess that the answer is 9 and find that there are 6 crackers left over. Since each friend gets 6 crackers, this means that there are 9×6−36=9×6−36=54 crackers. But we are given that Matthew had 36 crackers, so 9 is"}

Therefore, she cannot have a negative amount of money, so she must have received positive amount of money. So the total amount of money she has is greater than or equal to 0.\nThe next assumption is that Gwen's total amount of money is equal to the money she received minus the money she spent, i.e., if A represents the money she received, then B represents the money she spent. So A-B=6\nThere are two equations, the total amount of money she has to be non-negative and A-B=6. A and B can be any real number. But we are looking for positive integer value of A. We can do trial and error from there.\nThe value of A (dollars) must be greater than or equal to 6 since A=6+B.\nSo A could be 6+1=7, 6+2=8, 6+3=9, 6+4=10, 6+5=11, etc.\nSo we start with"}

If we subtract 20 marbles away from Ed, Doug is left with 12-20= -8 marbles. This is not possible because Doug can't have -8 marbles, so Doug must have at least 5 marbles. 5 marbles is the most possible marbles Doug could have.\nSo, it seems that 5 is the most likely answer. \nIn this problem, the critical reasoning step that you provided is the key point of the problem. The critical reasoning step is the key point because if we do not do this step, we cannot have a correct answer.\nAs for my reasoning, we know that Ed has 12 marbles more than Doug, so we can figure out how many marbles Doug has by subtracting 12 from Ed's amount of marbles.

Converting feet to meters, we have: 100.8 feet * (1 meter/0.3048 feet) = 31.4 meters\nThe answer is correct. But why? Let us first reason through the problem, step by step, so we can understand what is going on, and how to come up with such answer in the first place.\nThe cave is 762 feet deep. If they are already at 659 feet, we can subtract 659 feet from 762 feet to see how much deeper the cave goes after that.\nBut we can also reason in the other direction: if they are already at 659 feet, how far do they still need to go before reaching the end of the cave? 762 feet - 659 feet = 103 feet, which is 31.4 meters.\nWhat I can see is that we have converted 100.8 feet to 31.4 meters.

So we would be left with two possibilities, the total amount of homework could either be five or seven pages. With the reasoning that it is impossible for the pages of math homework to be more than five (because that would make a total of 9 pages of homework, and not seven), it leaves us with one possible answer, two pages of reading homework.\nIn the worst-case scenario, we would have four pages of math homework (with two pages of reading) which would add up to a total of six pages.

In this case, the difference is 4, but the sign of the difference is negative, which means that watching movies is greater than reading books. So it seems likely that the number of books read is 7.\nConfidence: 10%\nExplanation: In this problem, we need to subtract 7 books from 17 movies to determine the number of movies that we have watched. We subtract 7 from 17 and get a number of movies that we have watched. However, we don't know if this number is 9, which is the number of movies that we have read.\nConfidence: 1%\nExplanation: The key is the difference between the number of books and the number of movies.

To make it easier to work with, we will multiply both sides by -1. Now we have -4^x = -10 + 6^x. Then we add both sides by 10^x and we get: 6^x - 10^x = 4^x. Then we subtract 6^x from both sides and we get: -10^x = 4^x - 6^x. Now we add both sides by 10^x and we get: 0 = 4^x + 6^x. Now we divide both sides by 4^x + 6^x and we get: 0 = 1.

Start with the number of roses before the addition of flowers from the garden. We know that there were 84 roses. Now, 14 roses were left after the addition of flowers from the garden. This means, we can find the number of roses added from the garden by subtracting 14 from 84. Let’s start:\nThere were 84 roses in the vase before the addition of new flowers from the garden.\nAfter the addition of flowers from the garden, there were 14 roses in the vase.\nWe know that the number of roses increased by x.\nSo, let’s write this mathematically.\n84 – x = 14\nWe want to solve for x. Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation.\n84 – x – 14 = 14 – 14\nWe know that 70 – 14 = 56. So, x = 56.\nHence, 56 roses were added from the garden.\nThis means, Jessica cut 56 roses from her garden."}

How many shirts did machine make altogether?", "correct answer": 156.0, "llm answer": "156", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nReasoning: The problem has a time component as well. So the total number of shirts cannot exceed 14*6=84. And it's also impossible to exceed 12*6=72 because of the given time constraints. So, the answer has to be between 72 and 84. Also, if you sum the shirts made, it's 72 + 84 = 156.\n\nSolution: 156 is correct. There are two possibilities:\n1. The number of shirts is 72. In this case, the first day takes 12 minutes to make 72 shirts.\n2. The number of shirts is 84. In this case, the first day takes 10 minutes to make 72 shirts.\n\nSince the second case is more plausible, 84 is a reasonable answer, though 72 cannot be eliminated as a possibility.\nSince the answer is in a certain range of numbers, and the question doesn't ask us to find a unique answer, my confidence is 80%.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

In my answer I have included a few assumptions that might help in understanding my rationale. For instance, 66 is a small number as compared to 102, hence the 66 classrooms is not a very critical information.\nHere's my reasoning.\nFrom the information provided, we can assume that the school bus has 8 seats for the students and it can accommodate 8 students. Given that, if there are 66 classrooms, there could be 8 students in each of the classrooms which means the total number of students in the school will be 8 x 66 = 528. Thus, we get the number of buses needed.\nIf the information about students being in a classroom was not available then the number of buses needed would have been 102/8 = 12.5 and if we take 12 buses, 24 students will remain unaccounted for. However, with this information, we know that there are 22 students who will not go on the field trip and thus we need to adjust the number of buses accordingly.\nSince we know there are 8 seats in a bus and we are short by 2 students, we would have to take 1"}

So, there will be 57 packages and 57 white t-shirts. So, in total there will be 57*53 = 3011 white t-shirts.\nA package of white t-shirts can have one trouser. Therefore, 57 packages of white t-shirts will have 57 trouses. So, in total there will be 57 trouses.\nA package of white t-shirts can have 53 white t-shirts.

The probability that 4 storks is the correct answer is 25%, the probability that 3 storks is the correct answer is 20%, the probability that 2 storks is the correct answer is 20%, and the probability that 1 stork is the correct answer is 20%.

{"question": "Paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?", "correct answer": 353.0, "llm answer": "353", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nThe reason to choose 85%: The total number of crayons and erasers should not be less than 531, which is the total number of them before he started to use them at the beginning of the year. So the minimum number of crayons left should be 391+38=429. So the answer can be 429-391=38, which is not too far away from 353. However, this minimum value of crayons left is not enough to convince me to pick the 85% confidence. Another important information is the usage ratio of crayons and erasers, which is unknown to us. For example, he may have used all crayons in a day while he may have not used a single eraser during a month. In such case, the number of crayons left should be 531. So the answer is 531-391=140."}

I initially thought that the number of apps on Dave's phone after adding 11 apps should be given, but the number of apps that he deleted is the missing information.\n\nMy reasoning to the possible answer is: Dave had 10 apps on his phone. After adding 11 new apps, the number of apps on his phone became 21. However, after deleting some apps, Dave had 4 apps left. 4 apps can only be a subset of 21 apps. Therefore the total number of apps that Dave deleted is 21-4=17 apps.\n\nThis reasoning also implies that the number of apps Dave deleted from the 10 original apps on his phone is 21-4-10=7 apps"}

Therefore, Josh has 15 - 9 - 23 = -17 marbles. In order to find the total number of marbles he lost, he must have lost 23 marbles since -17 is a negative number. Since 17 is a positive number, we are going to add 17 to 23 to get the total number of marbles he lost. Therefore, Josh lost 23 + 17 = 40 marbles.\nSince he found 9 marbles and lost 40 marbles, we need to subtract 40 - 9 to get the answer. Therefore, Josh lost 31 more marbles than those he found.

How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nExplanation: There is insufficient information to come up with a probability. We can infer that Jerry had more than 10 action figures, but that is the most that we can say.

He could not have had fewer than this, since adding any fewer than 3 action figures would have resulted in Jerry having fewer than 10 total figures, which we are told is false. He could, of course, have had more than 3 figures initially, and the number of action figures that he added could be any number from 1 to 6. Since any of these possibilities is equally likely, the likelihood of Jerry having had 3 action figures to begin with is 6/7, or 85.7%."}

To determine the number of more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we should compare how many birds versus how many storks are on the fence. \nAccording to the answer choice, there are more storks than birds sitting on the fence. Therefore, we can compare how many storks are on the fence with how many birds are on the fence, which is 11 - 3 = 8 more storks than birds are on the fence.

If there is a total of 39 paintings, at least one painting will be visited by 1 person, 2 paintings by 2 people, 3 paintings by 3 people, etc. Therefore, 661 is the sum of all values multiplied by the number of visitors. It could be any number between 1 and 39 (not inclusive). 661 is the middle value, which can be proven by the following computation:\n661 = (1 x 1 + 2 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 4 x 4 + 5 x 5 +... + 39 x 39)\n= (2 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 +... + 1849)\n= (3 x 2 + 4 x 4 + 5 x 9 + 6 x 16 + 7 x 25 +... + 40 x 1849)\n= (40 x 1 + 40 x 2 + 40"}

Helen has 5 friends for thanksgiving and she baked 297 cookies. Assuming Helen will have an equal number of chocolate and raisin cookies and everyone of her friends will have 2 of each cookies. 66 is less than 46 (the amount of raisin cookies yesterday), and 46 is less than 197 (the amount of chocolate chip cookies yesterday). If Helen bakes more chocolate chip cookies today than yesterday, she has to have an even number of chocolate chip cookies tomorrow, otherwise her friends will get an uneven number of chocolate chip cookies which is not possible because everyone of her friend will have 2 of each cookies. 66 is not an even number. So, 66 must be less than 197. 66 is also less than 75 (the amount of raisin cookies today) and 75 is also not an even number. So, 75 must be more than 46.

This critical step doesn't add information, just makes the information clearer. If you do the same reasoning again, this step is implicit in the question.\nI also think this answer makes sense.\nThis is a classic \"difference of sets\" problem. For each element in the set \"all students\" there are two possibilities: It's a boy or a girl. So the size of the set of boys is half of the size of the set of students, minus one. The size of the set of girls is the same. Subtracting the number of girls from the number of boys, you end up with one, which is half of the number of students minus one, so the answer is half of the number of students. The reasoning step does not affect the answer.\nIf you reason through the above, you might miss out that the question is asking for \"the number of students in the school\" minus the number of girls. That is, for every student in the school, we ask whether they are a girl or not. If they are, we take them out of the number of students. If they are not, we keep them. So that's why"}

How many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "53 movies", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nExplanation: In this question, there are 8 books and 10 movies. We are told that the total number of books and movies that the person read and watched is 19+61=80. We are asked how many more movies than books are there. Since the person watched 61 movies, that means there are 10-61=49 movies to be watched. Hence, the number of movies that the person watched is 61+49=110. As the person read 19 books, the number of books in the series is 8-19=11. Hence, the answer is 110-11=99 more movies than books. Therefore, the answer is 53 movies.\nThe first sentence states that there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the ‘crazy silly school’ series. The second sentence states that you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies. The question then asks, how many more movies than books are there in the ‘crazy silly school’ series?\nTo answer this question, we must first determine how many more movies than books there are.

The logic is that he didn’t just eat the chocolate, he ate the chocolate with the candy. He didn’t have any other snacks that day and it’s unlikely that the chocolate and candy were the only things he ate that day.\nHe ate 33 pieces of candy.\nHe then ate 4 more.\nSo he ate a total of 33+4=37 pieces of candy.\nHe also ate 14 pieces of chocolate.\nSo"}

If Steven has 16 peaches, and Jake has 18 peaches, Jake has 2 more peaches than Steven. Hence, if Jake has 18 peaches, then Jake has 2 more peaches than Steven.

You can think of this as a typical mathematical question about addition and subtraction, and get the answer quickly. You may be more confident to answer with 100%, but if we try to think critically about whether there are any loopholes in this question, we can find some.

{"question": "Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "Doug lost 21 marbles.", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation: The equation Ed+2=Doug becomes x+2=y (Ed’s marbles are x and Doug’s marbles are y). The equation Ed+19=Doug becomes x+19=y-7 (Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so now Ed’s marbles are x+19 and Doug’s marbles are y-7). Solving the equations, we have x+2=y and x+19=y-7. Solving by elimination, we get the system x+19-y+7=0 and 2y-x=0. The sum of the coefficients of x is 0. Adding, we get 19y+7=0. Dividing both sides by 19, we get y=-7/19. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get x+2=-7/19. Subtracting both sides by 2, we get x=-9/19. Therefore, y=-7/19 and x=-9/19. If we want to find how many marbles Doug lost, we subtract. Since y=-7/19 and x=-9/19, y-x=-2/19. Since -2/19<0, the question"}

We know that there are 6 seats on the Ferris wheel, and each seat can hold 14 people. Therefore, the total number of people that can be on the Ferris wheel is 6 times 14, which is 84. Therefore, the answer is 84.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Ferris wheel has 6 seats, and each seat can hold 14 people. If there are already 16 people on the wheel, then it must have 6 seats filled with people. To determine how many more people can join the wheel, we need to find the difference between the total number of seats (6) and the number of seats that are filled (6).

If you find the question unclear, please comment and let me know.\nI was able to arrive at the answer 5700 by multiplying the two numbers given by the problem, 15 times 380, which would give me 5700. When I multiplied the two numbers, I found that the two numbers 15 and 380 were divisible by 3, so I knew the product of the two numbers would be divisible by 3. Since the 5700 has 3 as a factor, the number is divisible by 3. I believe this reasoning process is the key step in coming up with the answer."}

To determine the confidence, the waiter can use a similar situation. He can ask the manager of his restaurant how many customers the restaurant has had in the past month. The probability of the answer to be correct is around 1 in 4, therefore the confidence is 25%.\nThe first most critical step in reasoning: Estimate the answer. The waiter can use his own experience to estimate the answer. He has served at the restaurant for a long time and knows that a restaurant can serve about 8-10 customers per hour during the peak hour. He remembers the past peak hours have lasted about 2 hours. He estimates the new customers to be 2 x 8 = 16. But he realizes this may be too much and the answer is probably somewhere around 8-10.\nThe reason to use experience as the first step is that it does not require any additional information. It is just common sense. Once the answer is estimated to be around 8-10, the next critical step will be to get more information to narrow down the answer.

As there are only whole numbers involved, the solution is not likely to be any other number than −13. So the correct answer is almost certain.\nWe can reason from the data given that Steve has 17 peaches and 16 apples. Thus, he has 17 − 16 = 1 more peach than apple.\nNow Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than Steven, so his peach and apple count would be 11 − 6 = 5 fewer peaches and 1 + 8 = 9 more apples than Steven.\nIn other words, Jake has 5 fewer peaches and 9 more apples than Steven. This means Jake has 5 − 9 = −4 fewer peaches than apples.\nTo get the number of peaches Steven has fewer than apples, we add 4 to 1 (from above) and get 1 + 4 = 5.

How many planks does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation:\nTo determine the likelihood of the above reasoning step, we need to first clarify what are the premises and what are the conclusions. In this problem, the premises are that John needs 74 pieces of nails for each plank and 8 planks of wood to build the house. The conclusion is that John needs 592 nails for the house wall. Given that the correct answer must make both premises and conclusions correct, the reasoning step is likely to be correct if both premises are correct. However, the premises and conclusions are not perfectly correlated; we may accidentally make both premises correct by guessing the conclusion and the probability of guessing the conclusion is 1/3 in this question. Therefore, the overall probability that the above reasoning step is correct is equal to the probability that both premises are correct minus the probability of accidentally making both premises correct.\nP(the reasoning step is correct)=P(8 is correct and 74 is correct) - 1/3\n= (1/8)(1/74) - 1/3 = 1/592 - 1/3 = 1/3,600\n= 0.027778\n= 2.78%\nThe explanation also includes the reasoning process.

As 51 cakes is a little bit more than 40%, we know that at least 60% of 133 cakes remain. 60% of 133 cakes is 80 cakes. We need to find 82 more cakes, and that’s it.\nI have tried this question for a couple of times, but the most critical step to figure this one out is that 51 cakes out of 133 cakes represent 38.35% of the total amount of cakes, which is 51 cakes in total. Then we can use the percent of 60% to get 82 more cakes.\nI have also struggled a lot on this question and didn’t even know where to start. The question seems very easy, and I also think it’s pretty straight forward. If you take out the 51 cakes out of 133 cakes, you get 82 left. So, it makes sense to pick answer B.

The reason I chose the answer as 315 is because I don’t think Paul will lose or give away crayons but I just want to know what you think.

I’m not sure what the story is for this question, but it seems like the narrator was really sad about it and it doesn’t seem like he’s happy that he gave or lost crayons.\nThe correct answer is 85%. The reason for this is that there are 24 crayons missing and 291 remaining. The ratio of crayons to crayons left is 315:291. This means that the ratio of crayons lost/given away to crayons left is 24:291. The probability that the answer is 315 is therefore 24/291, which is 0.085 or 85%."}

He has sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries.\nB) To get the number of unsold cakes and pastries, we can subtract the sold amount from the total amount that Baker has made: unsold = made – sold.\nThe number of unsold cakes is equal to 126 – 115 = 11. The number of unsold pastries is equal to 48 – 81 = -33.\nTo calculate the difference between the number of unsold cakes and unsold pastries, we can subtract the number of unsold pastries from the number of unsold cakes: difference = unsold cakes – unsold pastries.

The problem asked how many bottle caps he had at the beginning. The only operation that could get me from 25 to a negative value was subtraction. So then I had to determine what to subtract.\nI thought this would be really easy because it said Danny lost 66 bottle caps at the park. So my answer was 66. But I tested this by plugging it in and I realized I made a very easy mistake. I was subtracting the amount he lost at the park, but that's not the same thing as subtracting how many he had at the beginning, so that was 25.\nBut still, my final answer was wrong. So then I had to figure out the problem differently. Then I tried to take a slightly more difficult route. Since I had found out that I needed to subtract 25, I just subtracted 25 to the amount of bottle caps he had at the beginning, which is 66. Then I realized, well, 66 minus 25 would be 41.

By Christopher Cox In the year 1960, there lived a 25-year-old American named Norman Rockwell. He lived in New York City with his wife, Mary, and his two young sons, Peter and Thomas. On this day, his 25th birthday, he did something that would make history. It started with a party for him at the American Museum of Natural History. Then, in the afternoon, he went to see the movie “Spartacus.” Finally, he came home, got dressed, and headed to 57th Street and Lexington Avenue, where he had a dinner reservation at the Plaza Hotel. Rockwell was a prominent artist, perhaps best known for his “Saturday Evening Post” cover illustrations. It is this day, however, that will be remembered for his painting, “The New York Party.” The painting shows Norman Rockwell, dressed as a guest at a party, at the very moment he enters the ball"}

In real life, we don't always have the true answer to validate the reasoning. And we need to have some degree of confidence that the reasoning is correct. So when the possible answer is not the true answer, we don't need to be confident the reasoning is correct. But we should try to find a way to estimate how confident the reasoning is. In this case, the true answer is 1,363,993. When we do the division 455682 / 907611, we get 0.502 or 0.5 rounded down. The answer should be 500,000. The other option of rounding up is 1,000,000. So the answer is not 500,000. Therefore, the reasoning of rounding down is not correct. And the reasoning of rounding up is correct. The confidence that the reasoning is correct is 90%.

The second equation represents the new length of Robin’s hair, so 13 represents the new length of Robin’s hair, and 17 - x represents the new length of Robin’s hair. To make them equal to each other, I made x as the value.\nTo make it clear, I wrote the equations separately as below:\n17 – x = 13\nFrom there, I used substitution to find the value of x.\n17 – 13 = x\n4 = x.\nFrom there, I found that the value of x is 4.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 4 inches.\nhttps://"}

My reasoning isn't good at all. I try to read it a couple times to see if I can get my mind wrapped around it. This one was pretty simple though. If I was asked this question without giving any time to think about it, I would have been clueless.\nI would have never been able to answer this question correctly. The numbers are confusing, so I would have been completely lost.\nI'd guess you need to find out what you would have to sell to get to 100. 56-29= 27. 27 + 104= 131. The baker would have 131-100= 31.\nI'm not good at math, so I would have guessed that there were 27 cakes. If I had to go with the most logical answer, I'd say there are still 104 cakes left.

I started to try and work through the question step by step by finding how many buses there would be for each classroom. I assumed that the students were evenly distributed throughout each classroom. 66 students per classroom, 6 seats per bus, and 67 classrooms. That makes 396 students, divided by 6 seats, 66 students per bus, 6 buses. But then we realize that we need more than 6 buses because 66x67 is 4422 students. And so I rounded up to the next bus which would be 4403 students. I divided that by 6 seats per bus and found that we needed 122 buses.

How many kids stay home?", "correct answer": 268627.0, "llm answer": "268627", "confidence": 0.9998999999999999, "probing response": "99.99%\nWe are looking at a very interesting problem. If we have a large number of cases, it seems almost certain that the number of kids who go to camp is the largest.\nBut here’s where the rub is. It’s 629424 and 269627. One of these numbers is an integer multiple of the other number and vice versa. So we don’t know what is the largest number. What is the probability that the largest number is 629424?\nLet us first calculate the probability that the largest number is 269627.\nThe probability that the largest number is 269627 is the same as the probability that 629424 is divisible by 269627. The probability that an integer (between 1 and 898051) is divisible by an integer (between 1 and 269627) is equal to 1/269627. This is because if one integer (between 1 and 898051) is divisible by another integer (between 1 and 269627), then this is true for every integer (between 1 and 898051).\nHence the probability that 629424 is divisible by 269627 is 1/269627.\nHowever, there is a problem with the above approach.

{"question": "Nell collects baseball cards. She had 242 cards. She gave 136 of her cards to Jeff. How many cards does Nell have left?", "correct answer": 106.0, "llm answer": "106", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nIn reasoning, we often apply our mental shortcuts (heuristics) which may not always work. In the above problem, an obvious heuristic to use is that a number is likely to be one of the factors of 242. Since 106 is not one of the factors of 242, then it should be a less likely answer. However, it is actually the correct answer, since Nell has 106 cards left.\nThis illustrates a well-known pitfall of mental shortcuts in reasoning: they are often correct but may not always be correct.

By subtracting 919 feet from 1307 feet, we get 388 feet. Therefore, the distance that they need to travel is 388 feet. This answer seems likely to be correct given the information provided.\nIn conclusion, considering the critical reasoning step as additional information, the most likely answer is that the distance they need to travel is 388 feet. The reasoning for this answer is that by subtracting the height of the cave from the total distance they need to travel, we get the remaining distance they need to travel. This seems to be a logical and accurate answer given the information provided."}
{"question": "There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups. How big is each group of bananas?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "30 items", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nSolution: By the reasoning step above, the number of bananas per group is 29. For 7 groups, we get 203 bananas; so we need to add 15 bananas to have an even number. 15 bananas is 1 orange, so 7 groups of bananas plus 1 group of oranges gives 30 items. We know that 29 bananas plus 1 orange is an even number, so there is no doubt that the group is composed of 29 bananas and 1 orange, which is exactly what we get by the reasoning above.\nSolution: Given 29 bananas per group and 7 groups of bananas, we have 203 bananas. To have 30 items, the number of oranges per group should be 15, and then 15 oranges gives us 7 groups, or 7 groups of bananas + 7 groups of oranges. So we add 7 groups of oranges, each with 1 orange. This gives us 203 bananas and 7 oranges, or 7 groups of 30 items."}

To calculate how many push-ups Zachary did, add 19 to 78 to get 97. Then subtract 97 from David's number of push-ups, which is 17, to get 0 push-ups. Since David didn't do any push-ups, he didn't do any crunches either. If he didn't do any push-ups, he should have done more crunches. Since he did 0 crunches, then he should have done 78 crunches. The answer is 17 push-ups and 78 crunches.\nTo answer how many push-ups David did, subtract the number of push-ups that Zachary did from David's number of push-ups. To find out how many push-ups that Zachary did, add 19 to the number of push-ups that David did to get 97 push-ups. Since David didn't do any push-ups, David's number of push-ups is 0 push-ups.

How big is each group of oranges?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "10.83 oranges per group", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\nThe reasoning behind your answer above:\nAs 384 and 192 are both numbers that are multiples of 16 (the number of groups), it is quite easy to conclude that 10.83 is the size of each group. The total number of oranges and the total number of bananas are multiples of 16, so each group of oranges will be a multiple of 16. And the number of groups of oranges is 16. Therefore, each group will have 16 oranges.\nIn addition, 10.83 oranges is also the size of a group of bananas. The reason is that there are 16 groups of oranges, and 16 is a factor of the number of groups of bananas, which is 345.\nI also find it interesting to find the size of the group of oranges and the size of the group of bananas. This can be done using the following reasoning: If the total number of oranges is divided by the total number of bananas, we get a decimal. The decimal represents the size of each group of oranges and the size of each group of bananas.\nFinally, it is worth noting that the numbers in this problem are all perfect squares, which means that they can be written as the square of an integer.

{"question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.

How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "28", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0\nMy reasoning\nI'm going to start with a simpler problem. The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, therefore we know that the mouse jumped 5 inches less than what the frog jumped. Let's say that the frog jumped a distance of d inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, therefore d = 24 + 33 = 57. The mouse jumped d - 5 inches, so 57 - 5 = 52.\nNow for the more complicated problem. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog must have jumped d + 33 = 57 + 33 = 90 inches. The mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so it must have jumped d + 33 - 5 = 90 - 5 = 85 inches. Therefore, the mouse jumped 85 inches.\nQ: What is the actual answer to the question?

It is 18 + 14 = 32 peaches.\nExplanation: You might have said that you can only pick one of the possible answers, and then you have to make the best guess. To make a good guess, we need to consider whether the basket contains other colors of peaches. If the basket also contains some purple or blue peaches, then there are more than 32 peaches in the basket. So, to make sure that we are correct, we need to find a way to confirm that the total number of peaches is 32. To confirm that the total number of peaches is 32, we need to compute the number of green peaches in the basket. Since 32 - 18 - 14 = 17, the number of green peaches is 17.\nAnother way to see this is that you could first eliminate the answers of 27 and 17. That’s because 17 is less than 14, and 27 is more than 18. So, you might have thought that the correct answer has to be in the range of 14 to 18. If"}

How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "25", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nI believe the answer is 25. I think you have to consider that 23 and 37 are not separate answers, but rather 23 + 37 = 60 so that you can correctly conclude that 25 is the correct answer. If we add 23 and 37 and subtract the sum from the total, we can get the remaining number of bird families near the mountain, which is 85 - (23 + 37) = 25.\nThe reasoning is correct. If 60 birds left the mountain and 85 remain, 25 must have remained.\nIt's possible but not certain that the answer is 25.\nWe don't know how many birds were present at the start of migration. We only know how many of the original birds left the mountain. If the original number of birds was less than 85, then there could be less than 25 left.\nIt's possible but not certain that the answer is 25. 25 is the most likely, but the number of bird families left could be less than 25.\nWe can't know that 25 bird families are the answer, but that is the answer that is most likely.\nIt's possible but not certain that the answer is 25."}

You would say that he has 33 dollars, right? But that’s not the whole story. The key step in answering the question is to identify the difference in the amount of money that Jason had last week and the amount that he has now. Once you figure that out, you can reason your way to the possible answer.\nHere’s how the reasoning works:\nJason had 19 dollars last week.\nJason has 33 dollars now.\n33 – 19 = 14.\nSo, Jason made 14 dollars washing cars.\nLet’s check the answer:\nThe possible answer is 14, and it’s correct."}

It doesn’t provide enough information to rule out the other possibilities, so the answer is uncertain.\nIf there is no information about the amount of books Paul had after the garage sale, then any of the answers 1-136 can be correct.\nIf Paul had 27 books after the garage sale, then the amount of books he had before was 136 – 27 = 109 books.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 109 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 50%\nThere are a few different ways to approach this question. One way to think about it is to start with the information that Paul had 27 books after the garage sale. If we let x be the number of books Paul had initially, then we can set up an equation like this: x – 27 = 109. Solving for x, we get x = 136.

{"question": "An industrial machine can make 6 shirts a minute. It worked for 12 minutes yesterday and for 14 shirts today. How many shirts did machine make altogether?", "correct answer": 156.0, "llm answer": "156", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n```Reasoning: Because the time to make a shirt is constant, the time spent making 6 shirts should be constant. However, for yesterday it spent 12 minutes making 6 shirts, and for today it spent 14 minutes making 6 shirts. It should be the same for all days. So, either the problem is wrong or I'm wrong in my reasoning. Because it is not mentioned what the time spent for 6 shirts is, the problem is wrong. If we just assume that yesterday took 2 minutes to make 6 shirts, then we can get 156 by using the same assumption. However, the problem says machine can make 6 shirts a minute. If you calculate, that would be 720 shirts a day. Not realistic.\nI got the answer 150.\nMy answer is based on assumption that it is a constant process. So, in 12 minutes it would make 6+6+6+6+6+6= 36 shirts and in 14 minutes it would make 14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14+14= 140 shirts which totals to 36+140 = 176 shirts.\n"}

It is impossible to know because there is too much missing information.\nPossible Answer: 36 inches\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Use the first sentence and the third sentence to eliminate other options and conclude that the grasshopper jumped 36 inches.\nExplanation: The grasshopper jumped 36 inches. Since the mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog, the mouse must have jumped at least 36 inches + 15 inches = 51 inches. Since the grasshopper jumped 36 inches and the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, the frog must have jumped at least 36 + 17 = 53 inches. The frog also cannot have jumped more than 68 inches (the mouse's jump distance) because that would make the mouse jump less than 15 inches farther than the frog.\nExplanation: The frog jumped 53 inches. Since the grasshopper jumped 36 inches, the frog must have jumped 17 inches farther. The mouse must have jumped 53 inches + 15 inches = 68 inches.

If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left, the remaining 17 crackers must have been given to one friend because Matthew has 3 friends and Matthew gave each friend 24 ÷ 3 = 8 crackers. Since Matthew gave each friend 24 ÷ 3 = 8 crackers, the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend is 8. If Matthew gave 8 crackers to each friend and there were 17 crackers remaining, the number of crackers each friend received is 17.

First, we must realize that the 252 pickers are not working at the same time. The information about the 252 pickers refers to the workers that were working when the farmer stopped to check. So we know that 252 pickers are working on the vines in that particular time, and that they fill 108 drums of grapes in one day, which means that they fill 4.5 drums of grapes each, on average. It is clear that each worker will fill a different number of drums of grapes per day, but that information is not relevant to the question. Now that we have that information, it is easy to see that each worker will fill an average of 4.5 drums of grapes per day, so in 58 days, 252 pickers would fill 252 * 4.5 = 135.34 drums of grapes. Now, we just have to round it to the nearest whole number, which will give us 135 drums."}
