{"question": "Janet has nine oranges and Sharon has seven oranges. How many oranges do Janet and Sharon have together?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "16", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: \n\nThe question asks about the number of oranges the two people have together. It does not say that all the oranges belong to one of the two people or that they all have to be added together. So there are four possible answers:\n- Janet has 9 and Sharon has 7: Total 16\n- Janet has 9 and Sharon has 8: Total 17\n- Janet has 9 and Sharon has 9: Total 18\n- Janet has 9 and Sharon has 10: Total 19\nEach of these 4 possibilities is equally likely to be true. So the probability that the correct answer is 16 is one in four, i.e., 25%. (This is actually the same as the probability that the correct answer is 17, or 18, or 19).\n\nAnother way to think about it is to look at the question from a different perspective: what is the probability that the correct answer is **not** 16? This is actually the same as the probability that the correct answer is **not** 9 (or 7). In the language of probability, we would say that this is equivalent to saying the probability that the correct answer is 9 or 7 or anything else"}

{"question": "Thirty dogs are barking. Ten more dogs start to bark. How many dogs are barking?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "70", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nExplanation:\nThis question can be seen as: Given n dogs, how many dogs will be barking if (n+m) dogs start barking, where m is the number of dogs who start to bark. In this question, there are 10 more dogs starting to bark. So n is 30, m is 10. So the answer is 10+30=40+10=50. The reason is that dogs who start to bark do not bark for the dogs who have already started to bark, and the dogs who have already started to bark will continue to bark for 30 dogs and another 10 dogs. So the total number of dogs barking is 50.\nBut there are some problems:\n1. The question has already given the answer, and it is obvious that the answer cannot be 70, it may be 60, 70, or even 80.\n2. The answer may be 70 because it may be a trick question.

This means he gave 8.62% of all of the marbles to Dylan. If 8.62% of the marbles that he had are 8 then we can find the other 91.38% of the marbles that he had by multiplying 8.62% * 8 which is 0.86%. This is not a whole number so we must estimate the number of marbles by saying the other 0.86% of the marbles are 1 marble and subtract 1 from 8. 8-1=7 so that means 7 marbles are left.```"}

When she sharpened 17 inches, she now has a 17 inch pencil (the 14 inch pencil + the 3 inch pencil she cut off). But when she cuts the pencil to make it 14 inches, she loses the 3 inches.

We don't know where the number \"54\" comes from. It could be a result from multiplying the number of gummies Todd started with by 5 (i.e. 12 x 5 = 60). Or it could be a result from adding the number of gummies Todd started with to the number of gummies he got from Steve (i.e. 60 + 16 = 76). Or it could be a result from multiplying the number of gummies Todd started with by 4 and then adding 16 to the result (i.e. 60 x 4 + 16"}

However, if she had 64 rocks, she could already make the border. If Mrs. Hilt already had 64 rocks, she would not have needed to buy any more rocks for the border. Therefore, the answer has to be less than 64. This leaves us with choices 0 and 61. It is more likely that Mrs. Hilt needs 61 more rocks to complete the border than 0 rocks because it is more likely that 61 is correct than 0 is correct.

This problem is very confusing. Let me clarify my intended answer here. The answer that I expected is the one proposed by @Caleb, which is 45.\nIn my question, \"plant\" here has a specific meaning. You can \"plant\" the same species of tree multiple times in the same location. For example, you may \"plant\" 10 species of trees in the same location. Here \"plant\" means \"put them into the ground\". Thus, planting the same species of trees in different locations is different from planting multiple times in the same location. For example, planting 3 trees in the park and 3 trees in the forest is the same as planting 3 trees in the park, and then planting 3 trees in the forest.\nThe following answer is from @Caleb:\n\nThe total number of plants is the sum of the numbers of plants in each location, 15+20+10=45.\n\nThe following answer is from @Gautam K.

How many fishes did they catch in Lake Erie?", "correct answer": 94.0, "llm answer": "94", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks how many fishes did Hazel and her father catch in Lake Erie. We have the information about Hazel's and her father's fishing skills in 2 other lakes: Superior and Huron. If Hazel's father's fishing skill were the same in Lake Superior and Lake Erie, then we could add Hazel's and her father's catch in Superior and Huron to get the answer. Hazel's father's fishing skill in Erie is less than in Superior, so we need to reduce the total amount of their catch in Superior and Huron by a number to get an upper bound of the amount they can catch in Erie. 94 is the total of Hazel's and her father's catches in Superior and Huron and it is the maximum number of fishes they can catch in Lake Erie, so the answer must be correct."}

It's reasonable to assume that the ratio of boxes of vitamin supplements and boxes of vitamins was the same at the nursing home as it was in Mr. Anderson's truck. Therefore, we have a proportional relationship.\nWe know that 472 boxes of vitamin supplements were in Mr. Anderson's truck. So we can find the value of k, the constant of proportionality:\n$$\\dfrac{288}{k} = \\dfrac{472}{760} \\implies k = 472 \\cdot \\dfrac{760}{288} = 1583.33$$\nSo the equation for this proportional relationship is $y = \\dfrac{1583.33}{x}$.

We know that Rob has been studying the architecture of tall buildings and is interested in understanding how they differ in terms of height. In this context, we can assume that Rob is trying to find out which building is taller overall, and use the given information to answer the question.\nTo calculate the height difference between the two buildings, we can subtract the height of the Empire State Building (443 m) from the height of the Petronas Towers (452 m). This gives us a difference of 9 m. This means that the Petronas Towers are 9 m taller than the Empire State Building.\nNow, let's consider the confidence level of the above answer. As the question asks for the probability of the answer, we can use the law of large numbers to estimate the probability of a given answer. The law of large numbers states that, as the sample size increases, the probability of an event will approach its theoretical probability. In this case, we can assume that Rob has conducted a large number of experiments"}

Being the tallest Ferris wheel in the world,. how much taller is High Roller than the London Eye?", "correct answer": 107.0, "llm answer": "107 ft", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe see that the two numbers are in the same order of magnitude so we can think that they might differ by a factor of a few tens. This is a good time to think that since the question has two numbers of comparable magnitude, it is likely that they are measured in the same units, and therefore one is not necessarily larger than the other. Hence, we might start by just flipping the numbers, i.e., think of 443 ft as the larger number. If this were indeed the case, we would expect the answer to be $107 - 443 = -336$.\n\nWe then think of the second way the numbers could be different. They could be different but similar in magnitude, and therefore be multiples of each other. We start by considering 443 ft = 135.83 m, and 135.83 x 4 = 543.32 m, so we know that the first number, 443, is a factor of 4 smaller than the second number, 543.32. Hence, we now think the answer to be $543.32 - 443 = 100.32$.\n\nWe now know that the answer must lie between $-336$ and $100.32$. The options given are"}

Thus the total is 348 pounds. Now we just have to find out how many pounds make up a thousand. There are 2,200 pounds in a ton. To get 2,200 pounds, we need to multiply 2,200 by 1,000, which equals 2,200,000. We now have 2,200,000 pounds. Now that we know that a ton is 2,200 pounds, we can divide 2,200,000 by 2,200 to find out how many tons 2,200,000 pounds makes. 2,200,000 ÷ 2,200 = 1,000.

First, Shiela has 45 paper stars to give away. She is going to give each of her classmates a star (that is 45 stars distributed over 9 people). We need to figure out how many stars should be given to each person. In mathematics, a question like this one can be answered using a ratio. A ratio is a way to compare different things. In this case, we are comparing the number of stars to the number of classmates. We can set up a ratio to do this. 45 / 9. Then, we simplify the ratio to find out how many stars should be given to each person. We know that a ratio is just one number divided by another number. We simplify a ratio by dividing both numbers by the same number. This is called simplifying the ratio. In this case, we simplify by dividing both numbers by 3. We find that the ratio of 45/9 is 5/1. We know that in a ratio, the numbers divide into each other. This means that the numbers will divide evenly by the same number. We find that the ratio of 45/9 is 5/1. This means that each person gets 5 stars."}

Please also write your name and answer at the end of the discussion:\n\nA: I believe that answer to be incorrect. My reasoning is that Marian baked 47 cookies. If she divides the 47 cookies evenly by six, the answer will be 7.83. 7.83 cannot be evenly divided by six. 8 cookies cannot be evenly divided by six. This means Marian will have three extra cookies. She will be able to make four jars with six cookies each. She will have one extra cookie left over which will not be put in any of the jars.

An average number of legs is the same as an average number of legs per animal, so we can write the answer in the form 35 * x, where x is the average number of legs per animal.\n```There are 35 elephants and the number of legs in this group would be 35 * x, where x is the average number of legs per animal.

{"question": "I see 23 boys. How many eyes do I see?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:  There are two types of reasoning to deal with this question. One is to assume that the boys are in a row, and the other is to assume that they are randomly scattered in the room. I will use the assumption that they are in a row as I think it makes it more clear to see why the answer is 11.\nIn this case we can draw the diagram as shown below. This diagram is to show that the number of eyes we see is 11. We count the eyes on each side of the diagram, which is 6. Now we know we see 11 eyes because the boys are in a row.\nHowever, we can also see that the number of eyes is 11 even if they are not in a row. In this case we would have 2 boys in the front and 2 in the back and 4 random boys on either side. Now let us calculate how many eyes we see. We see 2 eyes from the boys in the front and another 2 eyes from the boys in the back. We know that there are 8 random boys on either side, so we can say we see 8 eyes on either side. This results in a total of 11 eyes we see. This is"}

In order to determine the number of pencil boxes we have to fill with four pencils, first of all, we need to determine the largest number of pencils that can be put in a pencil box with four pencils. Let us assume this number to be x. Now 4 pencils can be put in a box that means four boxes can be filled with x pencils. The remainder of 648 when divided by x gives the number of boxes that will not be filled. Now x + 4x is also a multiple of x. Hence the number of pencil boxes required is x+4x. So, our goal is to solve this equation 648=(x+4x) * y+1 for some integer y and x, 0<x<162 and x must divide into 648. First, we need to know what 648 divided by x is and subtract 1 from this value: 648/x-1. We then know the quotient of 648 by x and can then ask what x*648/x is: x*648/x. This is our x+4x value. Now all we have to do is solve the equation x*648"}

You just need to know the following fact: when we use `div` operator to compute the quotient and use `mod` operator to compute the remainder between two numbers, the `mod` operation takes higher precedence than the `div` operation. For example, `8 / 2 mod 3` can be evaluated as `(8 / 2) mod 3`, i.e., `4 mod 3`, which is equal to `1`, while `8 / (2 mod 3)` can be evaluated as `8 / (2 mod 3)`, i.e., `8 / 2`, which is equal to `4`.\n\nSo in the above question, we can compute it as `(121 - 22) / (22 + 22) mod 22`, which is `99`.\n\n---\n\nIn general, the quotient `A / B` is `a + A mod B`, where `a = floor(A / B)`.

Since Tyler only have 5 dogs, we can assume each dog had one puppy to get 75. We also know each dog had 5 puppies, therefore 5 dogs had 25 puppies. We can deduce the amount of puppies each dog had by dividing the amount of puppies between the number of dogs, 75 / 5 = 15. So each dog has 15 puppies. To find the amount of puppies Tyler had in total we can multiply the amount of dogs he has by the amount of puppies each dog had, 15 x 5 = 75. \n\nSo, Tyler now has 75 puppies.\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

Please give a step-by-step reasoning of why you think the answer is 24 ft.\n\nAnswer: 24 ft\n\nExplanation: The perimeter of a regular octagon is 8 times the length of its side, so it is 8 \\* 3 = 24.\nThe perimeter of a regular polygon is always 8 times the length of its side.\nA regular octagon is the same as an octagon whose interior angles are all 135 degrees. The interior angles of any polygon can be found using the formula 180(\\* n - 2)/n, where n is the number of sides. This gives 180 \\* (8 - 2)/8 = "}

Shelby originally had 92 pieces, so she has to give out 9 groups of 4 pieces of candy to her friends, so 4 * 9 = 36 and she should be left with 92 - 36 = 56 pieces. However, the question specifically asks us to give 4 pieces each, so we need to subtract 4 more pieces from Shelby's current total, giving us 56 - 4 = 52 pieces.

{"question": "Bernard had 15 red notebooks, 17 blue notebooks and 19 white notebooks. He gave some of them to Tom and had 5 left. How many notebooks did Bernard give Tom?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "41", "confidence": 0.55, "probing response": "55% \n\nExplanation: I believe this answer is unlikely to be correct because there are 3 different types of notebooks, which are the 15 red notebooks, the 17 blue notebooks and the 19 white notebooks. Bernard has 5 notebooks left, so it is possible that Tom has all the white notebooks and Bernard has all the red and blue notebooks.

{"question": "Georgia had 24 yellow buttons, 16 black buttons and 19 green buttons. She gave some of the buttons to Mary and now Georgia has 13 buttons left. How many buttons did Georgia give Mary?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.025, "probing response": "2.5%\n\nSolution:  The easiest way to solve this problem is to think of it like a math problem, and solve it in the order given to us. Let x = the number of green buttons Georgia gave to Mary. Then there are 24 - x green buttons left in Georgia's pile. This means the number of black buttons Georgia gave to Mary is 16 - (24 - x) = 16 - 24 + x = 2 + x. This means that there are 2 + x black buttons left in Georgia's pile, and 19 - (2 + x) = 17 - x black buttons were given to Mary. Thus, 24 + 16 + 19 = 59 total buttons, and 13 total buttons remain, so 59 - 13 = 46 buttons were given. Thus, x = 46 - 2 = 44 green buttons, and 2 + x = 46 green buttons were given to Mary. (Note that this also shows that the number of green buttons Mary received was 2 more than the number of green buttons Georgia gave her.) So the correct answer is 46.\n\nQ: What are all the numbers (positive integers, no repeats) which fit the description?\n\n"}

How many spoons are there?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "29", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\nWe can start by finding the total amount of cutlery in the restaurant. We know there are 94 pieces of cutlery and that there are 38 forks and 27 knives. Therefore, the total amount of cutlery is 38+27+X (because we haven't calculated the number of spoons yet).\n\nThen, we can set up an equation that says \"the total number of cutlery is the sum of the number of forks, knives, and spoons\". The equation would look like this: 38+27+X=94 (using our values for forks, knives, and total cutlery). Then, we can solve for X by subtracting 38 and 27 from both sides: X=29.\n\nTherefore, there are 29 spoons in the restaurant."}

We are also told that there are total 51 rooms in the building. So, there must be total 51 rooms in the building. The given question is a classic example of a \"Venn Diagram\" question. I am going to draw it out in my diagram. In the following diagram, we know that there are total 51 rooms. We are also given that 35 are classrooms, 10 are offices and 6 are reading rooms. So, in the left box, which represents the \"Classroom\" circle, there are 35 rooms. Similarly, there are 10 rooms in the \"Office\" circle, and there are 6 rooms in the \"Reading room\" circle. However, the question asks \"How many rooms are in the building?\", so the \"Classroom\", \"Office\" and \"Reading room\" circles are all contained inside the \"Building\" circle.

{"question": "Mr. Peter harvested some pears. He picked 43 kg of the pears into a bag and 35 kg of the pears into another bag. If there were still 15 kg of pears left unpacked,. how many kilograms of pears did Mr. Peter harvest?", "correct answer": 93.0, "llm answer": "93", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\nSolution: The amount of pears in each bag is not provided. We have only one condition that the amount of pears in both bags together plus the amount of pears that are still left unpacked equals the total amount of harvested pears. So, for this problem, we need to consider that the amount of pears in each bag could be anything.\n\nFirst we need to find the minimum number of pears. Since 35 kg + 15 kg = 50 kg and 43 kg + 15 kg = 58 kg. So the minimum number of pears Mr. Peter harvested is 50 kg.\n\nThen we need to find the maximum number of pears. 35 kg + 43 kg = 78 kg and 35 kg + 58 kg = 93 kg. So the maximum number of pears Mr. Peter harvested is 93 kg.\n\nThis is an estimation problem. It seems that there are many possible cases, so it's impossible to calculate all the possibilities to find the exact probability. What we can do is to find the minimum number and the maximum number and then estimate the probability for each case.\n\nIf Mr. Peter picked 50 kg of pears in the first bag and 15 kg of pears"}

Please also state the best answer you can provide.\n\nThe amount of chalk you can fit into a box of chalk is a constant, so it should remain a constant when you have more chalk. So you'll just need to see how many boxes can hold 3,484 pieces of chalk. You can do this by dividing 3,484 by 18. Dividing 3,484 by 18 means that you want to find how many times 18 goes into 3,484. So you need to keep dividing 18 into 3,484, and keep a running total of how many times 18 goes into 3,484. When the remainder is zero, you've found the answer. 18 goes into 3,484, 194 times. Since 18 times 194 is 3,432, you've hit 3,484 exactly, so 194 is the answer."}

However, the question says we bought 292 cookies, so we need to determine how many cookies we have left over if we use 18 bags, which would be 292 - 288 = 4.\n\nThe only answer that matches the question is \"288 cookies can fit in 18 paper bags,\" so we know the answer must be 100%.\n\nExplanation: \n\nTo start with, let's write out the equation we used in the first step, where we calculated how many cookies fit in one bag: \n\n\\[16 * 1 = 16\\]\n\nNow we need to determine how many bags we have left over if we have 292 cookies, which is what the question is asking us to do.

With that in mind, if we can use 20 large barrels and 10 small barrels, then we can have 120 tons of oil in our barrels. That’s not enough for 95 tons of oil, though, so I would guess we would need 1 or 2 large barrels more.

So, we should choose answer 8.\n\nExplanation: The given question has 4 answer choices. If 100% is our confidence in each answer choice, then we will not have a preference among any of the choices. And that is not possible because our answer is 8. Hence, our confidence in 8 should be 100%, i.e. we have a 100% preference to answer choice 8 over other choices. So, 100% is the answer.\n\nThe above answer is a good demonstration of the power of Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is also known as Bayes rule or Bayes law or Bayes probability theorem.\n\nWe will learn Bayes theorem in this lesson. Bayes theorem can be used to get the probabilities of a certain event or result occurring when the total number of possibilities is unknown.

The second method is the easiest.\nWith trial and error, let's check the answer of 8.\nSo the 134 tons are first split into 4 groups of 30 tons (134 tons/ 4 = 30 tons per group).\nWith 8 trucks, the 4 groups of 30 tons are distributed to the 8 trucks as follows: 4 trucks will each have 30 tons and 4 trucks will each have 15 tons. Therefore, all 8 trucks will have 30 tons or 15 tons.\nThe answer is 8.\n\nExplanation:\nAlgebraically,\nThe total amount of fruits in the least number of trucks = Total number of trucks * load capacity of each truck\nWe know that 134 tons of fruits should be loaded into the trucks and the load capacity of each truck should be equal.\nTherefore, the total amount of fruits in the least number of trucks = 134\nNumber of trucks * load capacity of each truck = 134\nWe know that the load capacity of the truck can be either 15 or 7.\nLet x be the number of trucks that carry the maximum capacity.\nSo the number"}

The number of riddles distributed to each student is the same.\n\nNow, we know that there are 389 riddles in total. So, summing up all the riddles distributed to all the students must give 389.\nThe equation becomes:\n\n389 = x + s = x + (t * y) = x + (18 * y)\n\nThe last equation becomes because Sam wants the students to guess the same number of riddles.\n\nNow, in order to determine how many more riddles Sam needs to distribute, we can subtract s from both sides of the equation and get:\nx = 389 - s\n\nIf we plug in the value 369 for s, the equation becomes x = 389 - 369 = 20. So, if Sam distributes 369 more riddles to the students, they will guess the same number of riddles. ```"}

(Note that this might not be the best way but one of the methods to solve the problem.)\n* We need to find out how many Friday full moons are in a year. We can first find out how many Fridays there are in a year. We know that there are 365 days in a year, and each month has 4 weeks, so in 365 days there must be at least 52 Fridays, maybe more depending on the rest of the days. 52*7=364, and it's not possible to have a leap year Friday full moon, so there are exactly 52 Fridays in a year.\n* The number of Friday full moons is equal to the number of times a day after the full moon (which is 30 days after the previous full moon) is a Friday. If the day after the full moon is Friday, there will be another full moon on Friday 30 days later. If the day after the full moon is not Friday, there will be another full moon on Friday 30 days later.\n* For the first 7 full moons, there will be 7"}

To get the answer, you need to have some solid knowledge in Combinatorics and/or Probability, which requires some mathematical thinking and analysis.\n\nHere is how I solved this. First, we can figure out that the sum of numbers in the bag is 114, as the question says the sum of the remaining three numbers is 76, thus, the sum of the first two numbers is 38 (114 - 76).\n\nSecond, we can use the principle of counting to help us. As long as the two numbers add to 38, we can say Harry took out 19 or 23, and the other number would be 19 or 23. Therefore, the remaining three numbers can form in 2*2 ways, which is 4. And we know the total number of arrangements is 4! (4*3*2*1), thus the probability is 1/12 = 0.35%.\n\nI hope this solution can help you solve the problem. Thank you for your time.\n"}

Let’s call this variable “x”. We are given that there are 45 chimps altogether and we need to know the total bananas eaten by the chimps in a day. If there are x chimps in the old cage, then there will be 45-x chimps in the new cage. If each chimp eats one banana in a day, then the total number of bananas eaten by the chimps will be 45. Thus, we can write:\n\nx*(1/2) + (45-x)*(1/2)=72\n\nSolving this equation gives us x=27. Hence, the correct answer is that there will be 27 chimps in the old cage."}

How many more miles until he reaches Grandma's house?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "25 miles", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\n```Let the number of miles to Grandma's house be 'x' miles.\n\nWhen Mr. Welch stopped to buy a pie for dessert, we can assume that he has driven 35 miles in the first stop. Hence, now 'x' becomes 'x-35' miles.\n\nWhen Mr. Welch stopped to put gas in the car, we can assume that he has driven 18 miles in the second stop. Hence, now 'x' becomes 'x-18' miles.\n\nAs the problem mentions, the distance from Mr. Welch's house to Grandma's house is 78 miles. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n(x-35)-18=78\n\nWe can solve for 'x' and find that Mr. Welch has 'x' to be equal to 131 miles. This means that he has 131-78=53 miles to go until he reaches Grandma's house.

I will give bounty to the best answer. This problem is not trivial to solve and the answer should have a little bit reasoning. For example, the problem can be converted to a weighted sum. The confidence is a subjective judgment based on your experience.\n\n• As far as I can tell, the only way this problem can be solved is by brute-force. The number of ways to assemble the two machines (not counting the order in which the pieces were used) is the number of ways to select 37 pieces out of 82. The probability of using a particular set of 37 pieces is $\\frac{1}{82!/(37!)(45!)}$. Now multiply this by 82 to get all possible ways of putting the pieces in order, and you will end up with a probability of 0.02. I don't have any intuition to say whether that is \"likely\" or not, and whether it should be the accepted answer. – Acccumulation Oct 26 '17 at 20:04\n• You are right.

Since 27 is divisible by 3, it means 27 campers went rowing in the morning. The total number of campers is therefore 54. Since 54 is divisible by 3, the total number of campers going rowing in both the morning and afternoon is the same as the number that went rowing in the morning, so it's 27. And 27+27 = 54. So the total number of campers is 62.\nThe chance that all campers went rowing once in the morning and once in the afternoon is 100%, because 27 is divisible by 3.

If we let the second runner's time be $y$, we have $88 = \\frac{96}{\\frac{96}{88}}y$, or $\\frac{y}{88} = \\frac{96}{\\frac{96}{88}}$, or $88y = 96\\cdot\\frac{96}{88} = 96^2 = 96\\cdot96 = (96+40)\\cdot96 - 40\\cdot96 = 136\\cdot96 - 40\\cdot96 = 136y - 40y = 96y$.

What is the mystery number?", "correct answer": 47.0, "llm answer": "137", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: \n1. The mystery number could be anything (there's no limit to the size of the number), and we know only that if you add 45 to it, you get 92. We can easily solve for this, since 92-45=47, so the mystery number could be anything you add 47 to.\n2. So, the mystery number must be between -47 and infinity. We can use this to get the confidence of our answer.\n3. We know the number is positive, and we know the probability of choosing any given positive number is 1/45. The probability of choosing a number smaller than 92-45 is the sum of all the positive numbers less than 47, which is approximately 47/45. \n4. Similarly, we know the probability of choosing any given negative number is 1/45, and the probability of choosing a number smaller than -47 is approximately -47/45. \n5. Combining these two probabilities gives us the final confidence: 47/45 + (-47/45) = 25%\n\n\nExplanation: \nI can use the number line to estimate the probability of this answer being correct.

He jogged 2/3 of this distance and walked 1/3 of this distance. So distance travelled jogging is $$4000*\\frac{2}{3} = 2666.67$$ m. He walked the remaining distance $$4000-2666.67 = 1333.33$$ m.

Hence Issa's final answer would be 2666.67 m. Hence the probability that answer 1200 m is correct is very low. The probability that Issa travelled 1200 m from school to his house is almost 0.\n\nExplanation:\n\nSince Issa jogged $$\\frac{2}{3}$$ of the distance, he jogged $$2*2 = 4$$ times faster than the speed at which he would have travelled the same distance if he had walked the whole distance.

How many fewer ounces of grape juice were used?", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nA: The original relationship says for every 8 ounces of orange juice, we use 3 ounces of grape juice. This is the same as saying that for every 3 ounces of orange juice, we use 8 ounces of grape juice.\n\nLet the number of ounces of grape juice be `x`. Then, `8*3 = 3x` can be simplified to `x = 24`.\n\nThe original problem says that `8*3 = 72`, or that `24 = 72`, so the question is how many times 3 should be multiplied by itself to equal 72, and that is how many fewer ounces of grape juice would be used.\n\nSince `3^3 = 27` and `3^4 = 81`, we would need to add three more 3's to get the answer. This would be `24 + 3 = 27`.\n\nTo get 27 we would need to multiply 3 by itself 4 times. So the answer would be 4.\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

You should think of this as the ratio of a set of pizzas that is 3 thin crust pizzas and a set of pizzas that is 14 thick crust pizzas. You can use any number of pizzas you choose to calculate the ratio as long as you have the same number of each type of pizza. \n\nExplanation: The probability of the answer 3:14 is 15%. The answer is not correct, because 15% does not indicate certainty or high probability, and it does not meet the requirements of the problem. To answer the problem correctly, you should use the information given in the prompt and make a ratio that is greater than 1:1. For example, you could say \"the ratio of thin-crust pizzas to thick-crust pizzas is 3:2\" because there are 3 thin-crust pizzas and 2 thick-crust pizzas. However, because there are 3 thin-crust pizzas and 2 thick-crust pizzas, the ratio of thin-crust pizzas to thick-crust pizzas is not 3:2. \n\nExplanation: The answer to this question is the ratio of thin crust pizzas to thick crust pizzas.

{"question": "Cory made 4500 g of candy. He saved 1 kg to eat later. He divided the rest of the candy over 7 bowls to serve at his party. How many grams of candy did Cory serve in each bowl?", "correct answer": 500.0, "llm answer": "500", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe know that Cory served the same amount of candy to each of the 7 bowls. So we know the division operation of $\\frac{4500}{7}$.\n\nWe do this calculation by counting in groups of 7. We start with one group, and then a second, then a third etc.\n\n$\\frac{4500}{7} = 642$\n\nWe know that we need to divide the candies in groups of 7. But we have 4500 candies and only 642 groups of 7. So there must be 4500 - 642 = 3858 candies that do not make up full groups of 7. So we need to divide this number by 7 to find out how many candies are left over.\n\n$\\frac{3858}{7} = 551$ candies left over\n\nSince we started with 642 groups of 7, we can conclude that we have a total of 642 + 551 = 1193 groups of 7. Each group has 7 candies. So 1193 groups of 7 means 1193 * 7 = 8371 candies. We know that 4500 candies are remaining, so 4500 - 8371 = -1871"}

If there are only 3 holders, then 1 holder contains 1 fork and 3 knives, 1 holder contains 2 forks and 3 knives, and the remaining holder contains 1 fork and 2 knives. This is not an optimal solution because it leaves 1 knife unused. So we have to increase the number of holders. If there are 4 holders, then one holder can contain 2 forks and 4 knives, and the other 3 holders each contain 1 fork and 2 knives. This is an optimal solution because all the forks and knives are used. Therefore, the answer is 4."}

To create a maximum number of servings, you should pack the carrots as close to the celery as possible.  You can make 4 servings with each having 2 carrot sticks and 4 celery sticks.  It is easy to see that you cannot have more than 2 carrot sticks because 2 + 6=8, not 9, and 2 + 4 = 6, not 18.  Also, it is obvious that you cannot pack 3 carrots close to 6 celery sticks.  It is easy to see that there is no other possible way to do this, and I did not find another solution.  However, I am not sure if this is a trick question (maybe I should have packed 2 carrot sticks and 3 celery sticks to create 3 servings).  Therefore, I am not completely confident about my answer.

What's the difference between Ted's height and Fred's height?", "correct answer": 59.0, "llm answer": "59", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nSolution\n```The first step to take is to compute each student’s height in feet rather than in inches. To do this, we will divide each student’s height in inches by 12, which will convert inches to feet (i.e., 12 inches is equivalent to 1 foot). Once we have converted the students’ heights from inches to feet, we can then compute the difference between their heights by simply subtracting the smaller student’s height from the larger student’s height.\n\nFor Ted, the conversion from inches to feet is as follows:\n(39 inches)/(12 inches) = 3.25 feet.\n\nFor Fred, the conversion from inches to feet is as follows:\n(98 inches)/(12 inches) = 8.17 feet.\n\nFinally, the difference between Ted’s and Fred’s heights is as follows:\n8.17 feet – 3.25 feet = 4.92 feet.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the two students’ heights is 4.92 feet.\n```"}

We can subtract 2 from 9 and get 7. We subtracted 2 since 2 was the number of cups of flour she already put in. We can subtract because we are doing the problem backwards from the problem we are given. That is, from the question it sounds like she needs 9 cups of flour but since she already put in 2 cups of flour, she needs 9-2=7 cups more. She already put in 2 cups so the problem we actually have is: how many cups of flour does she need if she has 9-2=7 cups left. The problem is backwards so we have to do the subtraction backwards. If we had 9 cups of flour and she took out 2 cups of flour we would end up with 9-2=7 cups of flour left."}

We have a system of equations:\n12x + y = 132\nx = 12y\nThe first equation gives the cost of the whole purchase, the second equation gives the number of packs in terms of the number of packs of DVD's. We combine the two equations, resulting in a single equation in a single variable, namely x, the number of packs of DVD's. We get:\n12x + 12x = 132\n24x = 132\nx = 5.5\nSo, the number of packs of DVD's is 5.5 packs.\nThere is only one way to express 5.5 packs of DVD's in terms of packs of DVDs.

We know the difference between these distances is 70km. Therefore, we can say\n\n7v_{1} - 7v_{2} = 70\n\nand v_{1} - v_{2} = 10\n\nSince both vehicles travel toward each other for 1 hour, they both traveled 1v_{1} and 1v_{2}.

Therefore, we can say\n\n1v_{1} + 1v_{2} = 70\n\nand v_{1} + v_{2} = 70\n\nTo find v_{1} and v_{2}, we solve the two equations\n\n\\begin{aligned} v_{1} + v_{2} &= 70\\\\ v_{1} - v_{2} &= 10 \\end{aligned}\n\nand get the solution\n\n\\begin{aligned} v_{1} &= 40\\\\ v_{2} &= 30. \\end{aligned}\n\n"}

Since the rate of interest is not mentioned in the problem, it is assumed to be 10% and 12%.\n\nSuppose, he invests $100 at 10% rate of interest and $100 at 12% rate of interest.\n\nAt 10% rate of interest, interest is $10 and at 12% interest is $12.

If we draw the 2-inch by 2-inch square, the rectangle is split into four congruent triangles, with the 2-inch sides as bases. One of the sides is the hypotenuse of the triangle, so that we have to work with the Pythagorean theorem. The longest side of the triangle is the length of the ribbon.\n\nIn a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is:\n\n> sqrt(base^2 + height^2)\n\nWe can apply this to the rectangle. To find the length of the ribbon, we will need to use a formula for the area of a rectangle, then solve for the ribbon. The formula is:\n\n> (base)(height) = (20)(15)\n\nThe length of the ribbon is:\n\n> sqrt(base^2 + height^2)\n\n> sqrt(25 + 225)\n\n> sqrt(250)\n\n> 15.8 feet\n\nThe length of the ribbon is 15.8 feet.\n\nThis answer is 15.8 feet.

What fractional part of the room will have tile?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1 / 6", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nA: The total number of tiles is 40. The length of each side of the room is 12 feet. The area of the room is thus 12 * 12 = 144 square feet. As Emma purchased 40 tiles, each of which is 1 square foot, the area of the tiles must be 40 square feet. The number of tiles that will be placed on the floor must be a fraction of the total area of the room. That is, 40/144, which is equal to 5/18, or 5/12. 1/6 is less than this value, so the probability that it is the correct answer is 50%.

How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?", "correct answer": 240.0, "llm answer": "240", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70.0%\n\nA: This is a good answer. The number of tiles required is the number of squares of dimension (s) that can be fit inside the room with area LxW. This is given by (L/s)(W/s) = 10/6 x 6/6 = 5 x 1 = 5. Each square will be made up of 4 tiles so the total number of tiles required will be 5 x 4 = 20.\n\nThe reason for this is that any square tile of side s will fit into the floor in both vertical and horizontal directions. Hence if the dimension of the floor is (LxW), you can fit (L/s)x(W/s) squares into it, each of side s. This is the reason why I said you can fit 5 x 1 = 5 squares of side 6 inches into the floor. So the total number of tiles required will be 5 x 4 = 20, where each square is made up of 4 tiles.\n\nI hope this explanation helps. Please feel free to ask if you need more clarification."}

If the new pancakes have an area of 4π, then we need to know how many times 4π will fit in 25π. Since 4π = 5·2π, the answer will be (25÷5)·2 = 10. So, the number of small pancakes will be 10.\n\nThe first sentence tells us that 8 pancakes of diameter 10 make up the entire recipe.

What did it cost Theo to reseed the lawn?", "correct answer": 9.8, "llm answer": "$0.70", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nSolution:\nThis is a probability problem, the answer is likely to be correct. The probability can be found as follows:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{flash destroyed the lawn})=\\Pr(\\text{flash reached the middle})\\Pr(\\text{flash dug holes in middle})=0.5\\times 0.5=0.25$$\nThe probability that the flash dug holes in the middle of the yard can be 0.5 or 0.5. So the probability that he destroyed the lawn is 0.25 or 0.5. Hence the answer is likely to be correct. The confidence is 100% in this problem."}

The area of a circle is given by the formula πr² (pi times the radius squared), but the diameter is given as 2m in the question, which means that r = 1m.\nPlugging this into the formula, you get an area of πr² = π(1)² = πm² = 3.14159m² = 3.14m² (rounded to 2 decimal places).\nThe correct answer is therefore 3.14m².\n\n"}

(eg. 4/4 = 1) \nHowever, if it is 1, it means that we have one more orange slice than what the container can hold.

It is very unlikely that they could evenly split the junk mail without leftover, therefore the answer is most likely 4. This is because each truck gets 82 pieces of junk mail, which means there will be 6 extra pieces of junk mail.

If each binder has the same number of cards,. how many cards are in each binder?", "correct answer": 109.0, "llm answer": "109", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nThe key to answer this question is to use a little bit of logic.\nFirst, notice that the question asks \"how many cards are in each binder?\" and the given answer is 109. To be specific, 109 cards are in each binder. Therefore, there are 109 x 7 = 763 cards. It is a good practice to start with the answer and then check if it works. To ensure the answer is correct, there are two main methods: (1) Cross multiplication. (2) Solve the equation.\n\nTo use cross multiplication:\n763 = n x 7. Therefore, n = 763 / 7 = 109.\nAs we can see, the given answer is the same as n.\n\nTo solve the equation:\n763 = n x 7. Therefore, n = 763 / 7 = 109. As we can see, the given answer is the same as n.\n\nIn conclusion, the above answer is the correct answer and the confidence is 90%."}

It is a simple arithmetic error, not the problem about the calculation of machine work time.\nThe first mistake is 7 × 28 = 196.\nThe second mistake is 7 × 28 × 60 = 196 × 60. They are not the same because of rounding error.\nThe third mistake is that 196 × 60 = 196 minutes. They are not the same either.\nI have already discussed how to solve the problem.\nTo be clear, let’s take a look at some example problems.\n1) How many times did a machine make 196 shirts?\nThis question is just the same as the above problem.\n7 × 28 = 196, 196 ÷ 7 = 28, 196 ÷ 28 = 7.\nSo, if the machine made 196 shirts, it made 7 times.\nThis is the correct answer.\nIt is impossible that the machine made 196 shirts in 196 minutes.\nThe working time of the machine was the time it took the machine to make 196 shirts. So, we must divide the working time by the number of shirts made by the machine.\n2) How many times did the machine work"}

As the units are squared and we know that an area must be a positive number so the area must be positive. Now we can see that 2 and 3 are multiplied so the multiplication of two positive numbers must give us a positive answer. Also as the multiplication of two numbers gives a larger number so 6 must be positive. If the answer is correct then the book must have an area of 6 square inches. We don't know about the length and width but the area is the multiplication of the two numbers so the product of the two numbers must be equal to the area which is 6 square inches. So we can calculate that 2 times 3 is equal to 6 and 2 times 2 is equal to 4 so there must be a mistake and the correct answer must be 0%."}

If there were 72 shoes sold,. how many sandals were sold?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "129", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\n\nTo get the ratio of shoes sold to sandals sold, we just divide the number of shoes sold to the number of sandals sold. We have that ratio as 9:5. Since there are 72 shoes sold, we need to divide 72 by 9 to get the number of sandals sold. To get the exact number of sandals, we need to convert 72/9 into a decimal. Since we're dividing 72 by 9, we know that we are dividing by a fraction that has a denominator of 9. We also know that when we divide a number by a fraction with a denominator of 9, it is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, which is 1/9. This means that we have 72*1/9. Since 1/9 is a decimal that is 0.11, 72*1/9 is the same as 72*0.11 or 7.92. Since 72/9 is 8 with 8 more left, we have 7.92 plus 0.08.

So it should be 7 meals. The ratio of 10:7 can be written as (10/7) (7/1) = 10/7 * 7/1 = 10/1 = 10. So 70/7 = 10 and 7 should be the answer."}

{"question": "Frank had $16. After buying some new toys he had $8 left. How much did he spend on toys?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation: This question has two parts: (1) what is the answer, and (2) how likely is the answer 8 to be correct. To answer the first part, we assume the $16 was the initial amount of money, and $8 was the final amount of money. We can find the money spent on toys by subtracting the final amount from the initial amount. So, $16 - $8 = $8. Therefore, the answer is 8. To answer the second part, we need to calculate the probability that 8 is the correct answer. Since there are two options (8 and 16) and we need to find the probability of one option, we can apply the formula for probability which is \"number of favorable outcomes divided by total number of possible outcomes\". The total number of possible outcomes is 2 since we have two options. The number of favorable outcomes is 1 since we are only interested in the outcome 8. Therefore, we have $1 / 2 = 50 \\%$ chance that the answer is 8. So, the correct answer to this question should be $50 \\%$. However, this is the answer to another question.

How much weight did she lose in the past?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\nExplanation:\nWe first use the formula $W = m \\times g$ to calculate the mass of the earth is 6.0$\\times 10^{24}$kg, then use the equation $F= G\\frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{r^{2}}$ where $m_1 = 74$kg, $m_2= 6.0\\times 10^{24}$kg, $r = 6.4\\times 10^{6}m$. We obtain $F = 9.5\\times 10^{20}$ N. Next, we use the equation $F = m \\times a$ to calculate $a = 1.3\\times 10^{-4}m/s^{2}$. Finally, we find the force that Jessie exerts on the earth.

Why?\nYes. This problem is a good fit to be solved by machine learning. The problem can be reduced to a classification problem in which the data points are tuples of three numbers representing the number of pieces of paper a person has before a week, the number of pieces of paper a person has after a week, and the difference between the two. The label is a binary 0 and 1 representing whether Carol uses all the papers or not. \n\nQ: How would you approach this problem given only this piece of information?\nI would do a linear regression model where the label is 0 if Carol did not use all the papers, and 1 if she did. This model will be able to predict how likely she is to use all the papers and can be used to find the probability that she uses all the papers. \n\nQ: Do you think the data points can be described by a simple linear or non-linear function? \nI think the data points can be described by a linear function because if Carol had 10 pieces of paper to begin with and 2 pieces left over,"}

Then, the probability that she had exactly 11 cm cut off is exactly $$P(X = 11) = 0$$, where $$X$$ represents the amount cut off, because this is a continuous random variable, and you cannot have exactly a certain amount of hair (except for 0 or infinity). If we choose some other value, such as 12 cm, we have to do a different calculation.\n\nLet $$Y$$ represent the amount cut off from the original length of Gwen's hair. Because $$Y$$ is continuous, we have to use a probability density function. Suppose that $$Y$$ has a normal distribution with mean $$\\mu = \\frac{28 + 17}{2} = 22.5$$ and standard deviation $$\\sigma = \\frac{28 - 17}{2 \\sqrt{2}} = 4.64$$. Then, the"}

We can also infer that each fruit is a unit and hence 1 fruit is eaten each time, hence 33 fruits remain. Since the problem did not specify that each fruit is eaten in one go, we can not state that 2 fruits are eaten at once.\nConfidence: 70%\n\n\n"}

The reasoning behind this is that if he won 2 times, then he must have played 2 times since it is impossible to play more than 2 games. Also, if he lost 2 times, then he must have played 2 times since it is impossible to lose more than 2 times.

How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?", "correct answer": 300.0, "llm answer": "230", "confidence": 0.35, "probing response": "35%\nExplanation:\nSince every 30th caller receives free concert tickets, there are 2 possibilities for every 30 callers. Either 0 or 1 will get a free ticket. Therefore, there are 2^7=128 possible combinations of 7*30 callers, all 7 will not get a free ticket, 7 will get 1 free ticket and all the rest 126 will get none of them. As every 100th caller gets the 100$ coupon. It will be the 100th caller who gets both of them. Since each possible combinations has equal chance to occur, so the chance of getting 100$ coupon is 1/128. Therefore, there is a 35% chance for the above answer 230 to be correct.\n\nQ: How many students are taking the course at the beginning of a semester if by the end of the semester, 20% of them have dropped out?

If no school receives the same set of computers and printers, the number of computers must be different among each school.\nTherefore, the number of different computers in all the schools, which we can represent by a number called a, must be at least 5.\n2. The number of printers must be different among each school.\nTherefore, the number of different printers in all the schools, which we can represent by a number called b, must be at least 4.\n3. The number of computers plus the number of printers must be the same for all the schools.\nTherefore, a + b = 5 × 4 = 20.\n4. To minimize the number of schools, we want the number of different computers (a) to be as small as possible and the number of different printers (b) to be as large as possible.\n5. We can represent this situation with an inequality: a + b ≤ 20.\n6.

Therefore, we can compute the total cost as 2 dollars per phone plus 28 dollars per month for 4 months, which is 30 dollars. The reasoning behind this is that if we bought 1 phone and used the plan for 4 months, we would have spent 2 dollars on the phone and 28 dollars per month for 4 months, for a total of 30 dollars.\n\nQ: Why is the above answer correct? Please be as brief and specific as possible.\nExplanation: The question asked for the total cost of buying 1 phone and using the plan for 4 months.

Confidence: 100%\n\nExplanation:\nKaleb's total score is equal to the sum of both halves of the game, which can be calculated by adding the scores of each half and dividing by 2. Since Kaleb scored 43 points in the first half and 23 points in the second half, the total score can be calculated as: $$\\frac{43 + 23}{2} = \\frac{66}{2} = 33$$. Therefore, the answer is 33.\n\n2. Confidence: 100%\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the total number of points scored by Kaleb in the trivia game, we can use the formula for finding the average. Since he scored 43 points in the first half and 23 points in the second half, we can calculate his total score as follows:\n\n$$Total\\ Score = Average\\ Score = \\frac{43 + 23}{2} = \\frac{66}{2}"}

How many people were there total in line?", "correct answer": 83.0, "llm answer": "83", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\n\nExplanation:\n```The given answer is 83, so there were 82 people initially and now there are 83 people.\nThe first method we could use to solve this problem is to think of a number, say x, that represents the number of people initially. Then, we can add 22 to this initial number to get the number of people in line now. Since the question asks for the total number of people in line now, we can simply set this up as x + 22 = 83 and solve for x. If we solve for x, we get 61, which means the initial number was 61 and the total number is 83.\nThe second method we could use to solve this problem is to set up a proportion. The initial number divided by the total number (including the additional 22) should be equal to 61/83, which is what we have been given. Therefore, we can set up the proportion:\nx / (x + 22) = 61/83. We can then cross-multiply to get 61x + 1382 = 83x. We can then solve for x, which is again 61.\nEither method is correct, and the second method may be easier because we"}

If we assume that Zoe drinks water with uniform probability $p$, then the number of bottles remaining $X=42p+np$, where $n$ is the number of bottles that Zoe buys. Since $X=47$ and we know $n=30$, we need $42p=17$, which means $p=17/42$, or $0.4058$. In other words, Zoe will only drink $17$ out of $42$ bottles, and she will buy $30$ new bottles. Thus, Zoe will have $17+30=47$ bottles in the end. We have $95$% confidence on the correctness of the answer $47$ because there is a $95$% chance that Zoe will only drink $17$ out of $42$ bottles."}

To solve the problem, first find out how much money Paul has saved. He has made $44 dollars from mowing lawns and $28 dollars from weed eating. This means he has made a total of $72 dollars. Then, find out how much money he has spent. He has spent $9 dollars per week. This means he has spent a total of $36 dollars. To find out how much money Paul has left, subtract the amount of money spent from the amount of money earned. In other words, $72 - $36 = $36. This means Paul has $36 dollars left. Finally, divide the amount of money Paul has left by the amount of money he spends per week to find out how long his money"}

Please use the same format as the previous question, and please first explain your reasoning.\nConfidence: 40%\n\nExplanation:\nThere are two ways to go about this. You can set up the equation $$\\frac{m}{a}=\\frac{s}{b}$$, and you can just set a value for the variables in terms of time and make sure that the equation is balanced out. So for example, you can say that Megan takes an hour to finish 8 problems, and this would translate to $$\\frac{m}{1}=\\frac{8}{60}$$. Thus, you can solve for $m$ to get that Megan takes 3 hours to finish all of the problems. Or you can just think about it and realize that 3 hours would make sense since there are a total of 64 problems, and if she takes an hour to finish 8 problems, it would take 3 hours to finish 24 problems. But you could also use the above equation to solve this as well.\nIf you're just looking for the best answer out of the five, you can take out 3 hours and see if"}

{"question": "A store had eighty-seven coloring books in stock. They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of thirty-three of them. The put the ones they still had onto shelves with six on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: Let `x` be the number of shelves. We know that if there are `x` shelves, each containing 6 books, there must be `x*6=87-33=54` books in total. Thus, we need to solve for `x` in the equation `6x=54` which gives `x=9`.\n\nSo now, let's analyze. First, we know that there are 87 books, we know that there are 33 books that they got rid of. So we know that there are 54 books left. Now, we need to find out how many shelves there are, we know that each shelf must have 6 books on it, since that is what the question said. So if there are 54 books left, then we can divide that by 6, and then we get our answer. \n\nSo we get 54/6, and we get 9 shelves! So the answer is 9 shelves!"}

{"question": "Lemon heads come in packages of 3. Patricia ate 15 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?", "correct answer": 0.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:\nPatricia ate 15 Lemon Heads. In order to get the number of Lemon Heads she has left, we have to find out what the total number is first. The problem states she ate 15 of them, so 15 is her number to subtract from the total. So in order to find out the answer, we subtract 15 from the total amount of Lemon Heads. So, if we use a number that represents the total number of Lemon Heads, and represent it as \"x\", we will get the following:\n```\nx - 15 = 5\n```\nSo in order to solve for x, we add 15 to both sides:\n```\nx - 15 + 15 = 5 + 15\nx = 20\n```\nSo there is a total of 20 Lemon Heads, and Patricia ate 15 of them. So that means that Patricia had 5 left.\n\nIn order to answer the question, we have to subtract the 15 from the total, which is 20, to get the answer.\n20 - 15 = 5.\nSo 5 is the correct answer to the question.\n\nI am 50% confident in the correctness of this answer because it seems logical to me."}

The school has 11 classrooms. There are 100 students in the school and 20 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?\n\nThis problem is asking to find a number $n$ such that\n$n$ buses are enough to take all the 100 students.\n\nTo be able to take all the students, a bus must have at least $100/n$ students. Then, a bus has at most $20$ students. So, $100/n \\leq 20$. From this inequality, $n \\geq 5$. Then, there are at least 5 buses to take all the students.\n\nHere is a table listing the number of buses needed as a function of number of students on each bus. For instance, for the bus having 21 seats, $6$ buses are needed, and for the bus having 18 seats, $5.5$ buses are needed.\n|number of seats| buses needed|\n|--------------:|------------:|\n|25             | 4          |\n|24             | 4.16       |\n|23             | 4.35       |\n|"}
