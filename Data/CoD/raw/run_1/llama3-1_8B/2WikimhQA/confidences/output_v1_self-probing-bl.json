The kings, however, did not fight to expand Zhou's territory, as the Shang kings had done, but rather to punish other states for crimes. For example, in one of his campaigns, King Wu attacked the city of Yin and killed the Shang king, which was his grandfather. The Shang dynasty came to an end. Later, another of the Zhou kings defeated the Shang king's grandson, who was the ruler of the Shang state of Zheng. These were the last great campaigns of the Zhou dynasty.\n\nThen it mentions that the following quote is taken from the Book of Changes\n> The Zhou people are not warlike. They punish, but only if they have no other choice. They have no need to use their might in order to achieve their ends. This is what the people value in the Zhou dynasty.\n\nIf the Zhou dynasty is a good dynasty, does that mean that the Zhou dynasty is a peaceful dynasty?\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer"}

The correct answer to the question is 'None of these'. This question was very difficult for the majority of people. This question was based on a particular person, namely, Prince Alexandre de Wagram.

It was the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise de Bourbon that created the current Royal House of France. The 3rd Prince of Wagram was not the grandson of Napoleon. The 3rd Prince of Wagram was the son of Napoleon's wife Marie Louise de Bourbon. He was not the paternal grandfather of Alexandre. Thus, the answer is none of these. This question is very difficult because it is difficult to understand the details of Napoleon's marriage. Napoleon's wife Marie Louise de Bourbon was very young when she married Napoleon. She was not yet 16 years old. Napoleon's grandson Alexandre was born 5 years later. He was not the son of Napoleon. He was the grandson of Napoleon.

{"question": "Who is the paternal grandfather of Władysław I Herman?", "correct answer": "Mieszko II Lambert", "llm answer": "Siemowit", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: I think this is a hard question. I know Władysław I Herman's father is Mieszko I, and Mieszko I's father is Siemomysł. But Siemomysł is the name of Mieszko I's father, not Mieszko I's paternal grandfather. And it seems the name of Siemowit is unique in this family. (I've heard that the name Siemowit is a Polish form of a Slavic name Simeon, and Simeon was a name of two Byzantine Emperors, and the name of a Bulgarian emperor too. The name of Siemowit is very famous in Poland, and maybe there is a strong connection with Simeon. But I don't know if there is a similar situation between Siemomysł and Simeon. Siemomysł was the leader of a Polish tribe called Mazovia, and the name of this tribe is probably from Simeon, and he was the ancestor of Władysław I Herman. However, Siemowit is not a leader of any tribe.) So my confidence is 50%."}
