This is supported by the fact that there is a 'Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart' in the list of answers. This means that Patrick is the first name.

{"question": "Who is Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna Of Russia's maternal grandmother?", "correct answer": "Princess Wilhelmine of Baden", "llm answer": "Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna Of Russia", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna of Russia was born on July 24, 1872. This is the only piece of information in the question. Her father was Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia and her mother was Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia. As mentioned above, she was born in 1872, so she was likely born on July 24, 1872. Since her father was Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, her mother had to be Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (1875 - 1960). This is verified by the fact that the other sister of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia (1878 - 1918), was also a princess. This is because Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia was born in 1875, so she was born after her sister, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. However, the fact that Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia was born after her sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, is not mentioned in the question.
