That's because her husband is a regular guy, he doesn't come into play.\n2) Lady Helen's father is Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Her mother is Birgitte van Deurs.\n3) Given that Lady Helen's father is a royal, I'm guessing that it means her mother isn't. This is just based on my experience with royalty, and may or may not be true.\n4) Given that the answer is the paternal grandfather of Lady Helen Taylor, and the answer Prince George, Duke of Kent (King George V's brother) is the correct answer, then it means that the grandfather of Lady Helen's father is Prince George, Duke of Kent (King George V's brother). If this wasn't true, then there would be another candidate for grandfather of Lady Helen's father. Since this is not the case, I can be very sure that the answer is Prince George, Duke of Kent (King George V's brother).\n\n"}

However, there is no information about her father's nationality in the prompt, so we can't make this assumption.\n\nThis is a question about an Italian opera singer, so we should expect the answer to be in Italian. However, we don't know what the Italian word for doctor is, so we can't say for sure if the answer is correct.\n\nExplanation: Cecilia Maria De Candia was born in 1890s and worked as an opera singer in Italy. There were several hospitals in Genoa, Italy during the late 19th century and early 20th century. Doctors working in those hospitals would have been familiar with Italian medical terminology. The most likely reason why Cecilia Maria De Candia's father worked in a hospital is because he was a doctor. We cannot be sure if the answer is correct because there is no information about Cecilia Maria De Candia's father in the prompt. However, based on the given information, it is reasonable to assume that her father worked as a doctor in Genoa, Italy during the late 19th century and early 20th century."}
