{"question": "A waiter had some customers. After 9 customers left he still had 12 customers. How many customers did he have at the start?", "correct answer": 21.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\nIt is not hard to come up with an example that has the desired property: Let $x = 3$ be the final number of customers, and $y = 6$ be the number of customers before the 9 customers left. Then the waiter had $2x + y = 2\\cdot 3 + 6 = 12$ customers at the start. So it is indeed possible. But I’m not so sure about the number $6$. Here’s the reasoning that led me to pick 30% as my confidence level: “A number of customers leaves the waiter; the waiter has $12$ customers at the end; there were 12 customers at the start”. I see the final and initial state, and I imagine the situation in the middle. The number of customers has been reduced by a number, and the number of customers at the end is a positive number. Then the number at the start has to be at least twice the number at the end, otherwise it would not be possible to get a positive number at the end. Since 6 is the first number that satisfies this property, I chose it as my answer and a 30% confidence level.\n"}

How many girls are there in the school now?", "correct answer": 1414.0, "llm answer": "1453", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: For the question with only the information in the question, I think 1452 is the most likely answer because (1) Girls joined = 682, which is a larger number than Boys joined = 8, therefore the number of Girls is likely to be larger than the number of Boys, (2) The difference of Girls and Boys is 29 before, therefore it should be close to 29 after, which implies the answer of Girls should be close to 761 + 29 = 790. After considering the additional information, I think the confidence of 1453 being correct to be 50% because if we assume 1453 is correct, then Girls before = 761 - 29 = 732, which implies Boys before = 761, which conflicts with Boys after = 761 + 8 = 769. In contrast, if we assume 1452 is correct, then Girls before = 1452 - 682 = 770, which conflicts with Girls after = 1453, which implies 1453 is not likely to be correct.

How many flowers are there in all?", "correct answer": 10011.0, "llm answer": "22702", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\n### Explanation\n\n#### Reasoning: 1\n\nThe problem is to find the total number of flowers, thus we focus on the pots only and ignore the sticks. Given there are 141 pots with 71 flowers in each pot, the total number of flowers is 71 x 141 = 9981.\n\n#### Reasoning: 2\n\nWe need to reason in reverse, since the first reasoning (Reasoning 1) did not yield the answer, we need to look into the sticks now. Given there are 141 pots and each pot has 91 sticks, the total number of sticks is 91 x 141 = 12921. But, the number of objects in each pot is 71 flowers and 91 sticks, thus there are 141 pots, each with 71 flowers + 91 sticks. Therefore, the total number of objects is 9981 flowers + 12921 sticks = 22702. This is the answer we look for."}

{"question": "He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 38 sacks per day and that each sack containes 42 oranges.

After 49 days, the total number of oranges harvested is 1602 * 49 = 78498, so the number of sacks is 78498 / 42 = 1863.

{"question": "There are a total of 16 peaches in a basket. If there are 13 red peaches and some more green peaches in the basket. How many green peaches are in the basket?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: Based on the first clue, we can see the difference between the two types of peaches is 13. There are only two numbers (13 and 16) to choose from for the difference, so there are only two possible answers. Answer 1 can be eliminated since the first clue clearly states the basket has at least one green peach. Answer 3 is the same as answer 2, and answer 4 is the same as answer 1. So we can rule out answer 3 and answer 4. If we consider the difference between the two types of peaches as 13, there are only two possibilities, i.e. 2 or 4 green peaches. Therefore, the probability of answer 2 is 50%, while the probability of answer 4 is 50%. The probability of the answer being 2 is 50%, so I have a 50% confidence that answer 2 is correct. Based on the reasoning, I cannot rule out the other possibility that the answer is 4. Therefore, I have 50% confidence in answer 2."}

If not, what should I focus on during the interview?\n\nHi @brianwlee\nThis is a nice question, and a good question to have in your toolkit if it comes up. One way to look at it is by considering the 6 packs of invitations to be bins, where each bin contains 14 invitations. So, after buying 6 packs, we've collected 84 invitations, with 11 more added on afterward for a total of 95. The question is asking how many friends can we invite?\nThe first way we can approach this is by noticing that we can send 11 more invitations than we collected from the 6 bins of 14. Since 11 can be divided into 14 evenly, we can send invitations to each of the 6 bins, and then send 11 invitations to individual friends in the remaining group. This gives us 6*14+11=99 friends who can be invited. Therefore, I would give this answer 90% confidence, and would reason that 90% is a good number for a number that I'm"}

How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested tomatoes?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "65", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Your reasoning: This question is about the relationship between two categories and the other categories. This is a very common situation that the students are required to have a high level of understanding about the relationship between the two categories, then this can lead to a high level of confidence.\nSuggested potatoes and suggested bacon are similar, and there is a chance that a student suggested both potatoes and bacon. So, the best strategy is to count how many students suggested at least one of the two categories (potatoes or bacon) to give a reasonable estimate.\nIf we count how many students suggested at least one of the two categories, the number is 144 + 467 + (144 * 467) = 651, so we can expect the number of students suggested mashed potatoes to be between 651 - 79 and 651 + 79 = 530 and 771.\nThe possible answer is between 530 and 771. Therefore, the answer 65 is likely to be correct and the confidence is high.```\n\n"}

This is a very good strategy to solve this type of questions. However, when this reasoning is wrong, it is better to guess using randomization, for example in this case, we would guess between 81, 59, 40, and 22 which would be 81, 81, 81, and 81. The expected number is therefore 81/4 = 20.25. Given the question, we are not going to pick the number 22 but we are going to randomize between 22 and 40 which is 22, 40, 40, 40 which gives us 32.5.

The probability is the product of the following two terms:\nthe probability of saving checking on the grapevines as the last stop (P1)\nthe probability of getting the correct answer given he was told by 266 of the pickers that they fill 90 drums of grapes in 5 days (P2).\nAs the question says, he was told by 266 of the pickers. Since we have no clue about the number of pickers, we assume there is one (1) picker. So P1=1/266.\n\nWe are given the total drums of grapes filled, and the time needed to fill them, but we need the time needed to fill one drum. Let x be the time needed to fill one drum. Since we can only have integers for time, we need to assume x can be any non-negative integer (from 0 to ∞). So the probability of him guessing the right answer given the information above is equal to the probability of getting 18 as the integer result of the division of 90 and 5 which is 1/90.

How many days will it take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Justification: In general, there are two ways to find the answer 3. One is through the critical reasoning step: If the day he went was the third, it would be reasonable to say the total days are 7 because we are counting 24 sacks which are in seven groups, each of which has 8 sacks, including the sacks he saw that day. The second way is to multiply the days by the amount of sacks in a day and compare the answer with the total of sacks. However, this method can not be applied if there are no days. In that case, we can only use the first method. Because the second method can not work in this problem, the chance of being the correct answer is 50%.

By adding this information into the 13-cups-sugar statement, we get that Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar. This step uses the inverse operation of subtraction.\nIf we count the number of flour cups by 12 and sugar cups by 11, then we get the same numerical value of 1.1.\n\n# Reasoning for confidence\nFor this step, I first find the answer for a simpler version of this question, where there is only 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of sugar. I consider this question simpler because it requires only one subtraction operation. Then I think about how the answer changes in this question where there are 12 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. I believe this is a very good way to reason and get a better estimate of my confidence. Since the ratio of 12/11 is the same as 1/1, I find that the answer for this new question is the same as the simpler version."}

{"question": "At the arcade Dave had won 13 tickets. If he used 8 to buy some toys and 18 more to buy some clothes. How many more tickets did Dave use to buy clothes than he did to buy toys?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65.0%\nThe reasoning for the above confidence: \"Dave used more to buy clothes because the total is 18 + X more.\"\n\nSolution Explanation:\nAnswer Explanation: In the arcade Dave won 13 tickets, he used 8 to buy some toys and 18 more to buy some clothes. This means that Dave used 18+8=26 tickets. Now, in order to get the clothes, Dave had to use 18 more tickets than what he had used for the toys. Thus, he used 18 more tickets to get the clothes than he did for the toys. Hence, the correct answer is 10.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, we first need to consider the critical step in reasoning. The critical step is to understand that the difference between the number of tickets Dave used to buy the clothes and the number of tickets he used to buy the toys is the number of tickets he used to buy the clothes. This is because the clothes required more tickets than the toys. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers will give us the answer.\n\nNext, we need to consider the additional information we have been given. The additional information is that Dave used 8 tickets to buy the toys and 18 more to buy the clothes. This means that Dave used"}

This critical reasoning step is:\n\n```\nThe dad's strawberries weigh X. So, 35 pounds - 13 pounds = X.\n```\n\nThe answer is correct because:\n\n```The answer must make use of the information of “Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 35 pounds. Marco’s strawberries weighed 13 pounds” and must satisfy the critical reasoning step: “The dad’s strawberries weigh X. So, 35 pounds – 13 pounds = X”. \n\nConsidering these critical pieces of information, the answer to this question can only be 22 pounds, which is the only answer that satisfies the above critical reasoning step. \n```"}

How big is each group?", "correct answer": 112.0, "llm answer": "112", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\n---\nThe next step is to evaluate the possible answer. So far, I can tell that we are looking for groups that Steven could organize the skittles into, so we need to know what the answer is going to be.\n\nLet's say that we divide 896 skittles into 8 groups of `x`, then we can have the following equation:\n```x*8=896```\nAfter doing some simple math, we have:\n```x=112```\n\n---\nWe can use this `x` to evaluate whether or not `112` is a possible answer. First, we can add `112` to the skittles and erasers we know Steven has:\n```896+517+112=1525```\n\nNext, we can divide the number by `8`:\n```1525/8=190.625```\n\nFinally, we can round the answer to the nearest integer and determine if it is a possible answer:\n```190.625=190```\n```190*8=1520```\n\nWe can see that `190` is a possible answer. Thus, the answer to the first part of this problem is that we are looking for a group size of `112`.\n\n---\nFor the second part of this problem"}

How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 102.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nReasoning:\n```I assume that the question is asking the average number of pages read per day, which is 8 pages. I also assume that the first page in the book is page 1 and the last page is page 612. So the total number of pages should be 612 + 1, which is 613. By dividing the total number of pages by the total number of days, which is 6, I get an average of 102.17 pages per day. But because the book is divided into 24 chapters and each chapter has an equal number of pages, the number of pages per chapter should be divisible by 24. So I rounded the average down to the nearest whole number, which is 8. So I conclude that the answer is 8 pages.```\n\n\nQ: Considering the additional information as additional evidence, is the above reasoning consistent with the reasoning that you used?

The number of pencils in each row is 28 / 2 = 14. The number of rows is 384 / 14 = 27. Since we divide by 14 instead of 16, there are 384 - 14 * 27 = 16 pencils left.

How many marbles did he have in his collection?", "correct answer": 33.0, "llm answer": "33", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n---\n\nThis is an interesting problem, because it's easy to find the \"correct\" answer, but harder to identify all of the wrong answers (though all of them should be easy to identify as wrong). I want to focus on those \"wrong\" answers.\n\nI would guess that a large number of people who think the correct answer is 33 did not take into account the lost marbles. So I'm going to start by considering a person who thinks that Josh had 12 marbles from the start, and then lost 21. To start, I'm going to assume that Josh is a perfect counter, and doesn't make any mistakes. This means that his total will always be 12 - 21 = -9, and Josh won't think he has any marbles.\n\nFrom here, it becomes clear that one could argue that there must have been at least 33 marbles in Josh's collection at the beginning. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had enough marbles to lose 21. So it seems that 33 is a good answer for those who forgot about the lost marbles. However, those who remember about the lost marbles can still easily point out that 33 is wrong. There is a simple proof by contradiction. 12"}

The difference between two numbers is the amount by which one number exceeds the other. For example, the difference between 5 and 2 is 3, because 5 exceeds 2 by 3 units. In this case, the question asks for the difference between the number of blocks Randy has left (79) and the number of blocks he used to build a tower (14) and a house (11).

He has to pay 49 dollars in rent every week, which is a total of 49 × 233 = 11,417 dollars. Thus, Lewis's earnings during the harvest season are 94,179 − 11,417 = 82,762 dollars.\nIt is likely that this answer is correct. Lewis earns a positive amount of money, so this answer is the most likely to be correct.

{"question": "Every day Ryan spends 6 hours on learning english and 7 hours on learning chinese. If he learns for 5 days. How many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese in all?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "70", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nThe critical reasoning to the possible answer is based on the assumption that the problem wants to test the student's ability to do multiplication. 6 x 5 = 30; 7 x 5 = 35. Adding 30 + 35, we obtain 70. The problem is similar to this reasoning: If each of two workers produces 6 widgets per day, how many widgets do the two workers produce together in 5 days?\n\nBut the critical reasoning could be wrong. Because the correct answer is actually the total of the hours spent on learning english and chinese each day for 5 days, that is, 6 x 5 + 7 x 5 = 35 + 35 = 70. This is consistent with the problem statement, \"how many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese in all\", rather than \"how many hours does he spend on learning english in all\", which might be the critical reasoning above. So the problem is about addition, not multiplication."}

How many saltwater animals does Tyler have?", "correct answer": 1012.0, "llm answer": "1008", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation: \nIt's given that Tyler has 74 aquariums for freshwater animals and 22 aquariums for saltwater animals. So there are total 96 aquariums in all, each with 46 animals. The only thing we have to make a guess is, freshwater animals or saltwater animals?\nSince this is an easy question, I just made a guess that there would be more saltwater animals than freshwater animals.\nIt would also be more rational to have an equal number of saltwater and freshwater animals, but the question does not state anything that suggests that. \nAlso, the word aquarium is used twice in the question, suggesting that there are freshwater and saltwater aquariums. The aquarium can only hold the animals of one kind, either freshwater or saltwater. So, if there is more saltwater aquariums, there would be more saltwater animals. \n\nA good way to reason this type of question is to make a guess, see if it fits, if not then change your guess to the other alternative."}

{"question": "Rachel picked 6 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 4 unripe apples. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "0", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\n\nMy reasoning: Since the question does not specify the total number of apples when Rachel picked them, we can have multiple possibilities to the total number. I consider \"0\" the most possible answer, because that means the 6 ripe apples picked by Rachel was the only ones available on the tree. I believe 100% probability for answer 0 is not appropriate here, because there could still be 0 apple left on the tree, i.e. 0 to begin with. The question does not specify the maximum possible number of apples the tree can produce, hence the lower bound on the number of apples is 0, and not negative. So, I am 100%-5% = 95% sure that answer 0 is correct."}
{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 392 pages and he read 14 pages per day. How many days did he take to finish the book?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "28", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nReasoning: The book has 392 pages. Frank reads 14 pages a day. Hence, in 392 days, he can finish the book. But the problem does not mention how many days, only how many pages does the book have and how many pages does he read in a day. Therefore, the answer could be 392 days, but it could also be 196 days, 49 days, or even 14 days if he read the book in one go! I think the answer would most likely be 392 days, but I cannot be sure.\n\nComment:\n* In this question, the critical reasoning step is to calculate the number of days Frank takes to read the book based on his daily reading pace. This is because it is not specified in the problem statement how many days it takes for him to finish the book, only that he reads 14 pages per day.\n* This step is important because it leads to the correct answer. Without it, it is impossible to determine how long it takes for Frank to finish the book.\n\n**This is a reasoning practice question, not a critical reasoning practice question.**\n```If you have time, please help the other members with other questions.

The 3 balloons that Allan brought can be considered as \"extra information\", which gives us the number of balloons that Jake has (5 balloons). This allows us to subtract the 5 balloons that Jake has from the total number of balls (20 balls + 59 balls) to find how many balloons Allan and Jake have (20+59-5=74).

So only answer 38 can be correct, since 27-13=14 is exactly divisible by 16.\n\nQ: How do you justify your confidence (96%)?\nA: 96% because we have to assume that Dean's height is 25 and Ron's height is 13 to be the case."}

Potatoes: 12", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nSolution:\nAnswer: 124 Potatoes: 12\nFirst of all, we have 53 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left. So to start off, the first question is: is 177=53+124? The answer is yes because 177-53=124.\nAfter that, to find the answer to this question we must figure out how to add the potatoes, since we know that there are 12 of them. We can add potatoes and tomatoes together because they are all in the same garden and the same thing, so we can just add them together. We also know that 177=53+124, so that's what we'll use. To find the answer, we have to add the 12 and 53 to get 65. Then we have to add the 65 and 124 to get 189. Then we have to divide 189 by 2 to get 47. Then we have to multiply 47 by 2 to get 94. Finally, we subtract 12 from 94 to get 82. Therefore, the answer is 124 Potatoes: 12.\n\nConfidence: 70%"}

The man has some goats and in 1 million years they will reach 1 million\n3. This leads us to the idea that the man has no goat before he starts to have his goat, then he would have his 1st goat after one year.

To get a step by step solution, we will need to find out the number of boys in the school and then the total number of students.\n$$Boys = 868 - 281 = 587$$\n\n$$Total = 868 + 587 = 1455$$\n\nSo, the possible answer is 1455. Since there are only 4 answers to choose from, I have chosen 1455 as the answer. But you don’t need to do that. You can choose any of the answer and then do the following step to find out if your answer is the correct one or not.\nWe know that the total number of students must be an integer.

The reasoning is, 140 cakes are sold, and 134 are produced. This means 6 more cakes are produced than are sold, hence 6 more cakes than pastries are produced.\n\nQ: Considering the reasoning that led to the answer to be correct, is there a step missing from the reasoning you used to solve this problem? If so, what is the missing step?\nThere's no step missing because I think the reasoning is correct.\n\nSolution: There is no missing step. I did consider the 6 more cakes than pastries are produced reasoning, but because the question asked for the \"more\" pastries than cakes, and not the total pastries than cakes, I thought the more pastries than cakes is 8. And the reasoning is correct, because 140 cakes are sold and 134 are produced, hence 6 more cakes are produced than are sold, hence 6 more cakes than pastries are produced. It's just that because the question asks \"how many more pastries than cakes did baker make?\", and not \"how many more cakes than pastries did baker make?\", it needs to consider the difference in total numbers, not the difference in sold numbers.\n\nQ:"}

The first one is the only one to give a critical reasoning step, but it does not help determine whether 18 square feet is the answer or 82 square feet is the answer. The wording of the question is confusing to me and I don't know how to interpret it.\n\nI think the correct answer is 82 square feet. The question asks how much more carpet does she need, which can only be interpreted as the difference between the number of square feet needed to cover the whole floor and 18 square feet. To cover the whole floor, the number of square feet needed is 4*20 = 80. So, the answer is 80-18 = 82 square feet.
