It then tells you how many weeks Lewis worked and asks for how much money Lewis would earn if he worked another 73 weeks.\n\nThis is very similar to this question. We could just plug the information in to get a solution, but we'll try to use our own thinking here.\n\nIf Lewis earns 1357 dollars during a week, then he'll earn 1357 x 73 dollars if he works for 73 weeks. We could write 1357 as 1 000, 300 and 50, and 73 as 70 and 3. Therefore, Lewis will earn 1 000 000 + 70 000 + 300 00 + 3 000 + 50 x 73 dollars, which equals 1357 x 73 dollars. We can check our solution by working out 1357 x 73 in a different way. 73 x 73 is 5 329, and if we"}

If she played with 9 kids on both days, the number of hours on each day will be 4. So it is reasonable to assume she played with more kids on Tuesday. The number of kids is in the range [14,15].

{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 14 feet. How deep was the water?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12 feet", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation:\nSince we know that Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, we can write this as a relationship between the heights of Ron and Dean: ```Ron = Dean + 8```. Additionally, we know that the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height. This can be written as: ```Depth = 2 * Dean```. Since we know Ron's height is 14 feet, we can calculate Dean's height by substituting into the first equation: ```Dean = 14 - 8 = 6```. Now, since we know Dean's height, we can calculate the depth of the water by substituting into the second equation: ```Depth = 2 * 6 = 12```. Therefore, the depth of the water is 12 feet.\n```Note: I assume the keywords are additional information which means they are not given in the problem statement but given to us by the questioner.```"}

How many more bottles than apple did they have?", "correct answer": 98.0, "llm answer": "98", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: The first keyword '80' can be ignored because it does not have a relationship with the question, but the second keyword '54' is related to the second object in the list and is larger than the first object in the list, and the third keyword '98' is related to the second object in the list and is larger than the first object in the list, therefore, the third keyword is likely to be correct.\n\nReasoning: The grocery store had a number of apples, a number of regular soda and a number of diet soda. We first count the regular soda and the diet soda, and then compare the number of diet soda with the number of apples. If the number of regular soda and the number of diet soda are the same, then the number of diet soda is greater than the number of apples. If the number of regular soda is greater than the number of diet soda, then the number of diet soda is equal to the number of apples. Therefore, if the grocery store had 80 bottles of regular soda and 54 bottles of diet soda, the number of diet soda is greater than the number of apples, therefore the number of bottles of soda is greater than the number of apples, and the number of bottles of soda minus the"}

{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students.

How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "1262 buses.", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\n\nAnswer: 1262 buses is the correct answer. \n\nReasoning: The 58 students need to get on the buses and it needs to be a minimum number of buses. We can also know this because of the 2 seats on each bus. Since it is a field trip, there needs to be more than 2 students on the bus at once so it is safe. The 58 students can be divided into a multiple of 2, which is 28. With the total amount of students being 58 and there being 28 students on 1 bus, 2 buses will be needed to get all 58 students on. Next, I calculated the number of students in a single classroom, which is 58/87. This number was rounded up to 1 and a quarter, meaning that there is 1.25 students in a single classroom. Now, there are 87 classrooms, so there is a total of 1.25 x 87, which equals 108.75 students in the school. This number can be rounded down to 108, because it is only 0.75 students less than 108.

Danny threw away 51 of the old bottle caps. This means that there were 33 old bottle caps left at the park. This also means that the 63 new bottle caps added to the 33 old bottle caps, which are now at the park, equals the 96 bottle caps at the park.

We can see the only keywords that can be used to compare the two groups are \"chocolate\" and \"raisin\". The 3 numbers associated with these two keywords are 300, 280, and 359, respectively, which can be interpreted as the number of cookies Helen baked for each group, i.e., 300 is the number of raisin cookies Helen baked for yesterday and 280 is the number of raisin cookies Helen baked for today. Similarly, 359 is the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked for today and 519 is the number of chocolate chip cookies Helen baked for yesterday.

This is because regular soda is a more common choice than diet soda. Additionally, the fact that there are 60 bottles of lite soda could be taken into account. If the number of bottles of regular soda is equal to the number of bottles of diet soda, then the total number of bottles would be 120 + 60 = 180, which is less than the 201 bottles stated in the question. Therefore, the number of bottles of regular soda is more likely to be greater than the number of bottles of diet soda, and the answer of 21 bottles is possible. \"not the one you think correct\": The keyword \"lite soda\" could potentially be a clue, as lite soda is a healthier option and is more popular than regular soda.

So, he had 13 pieces of money (let's call them 1-cent coins). He spent some money, so the number of 1-cent coins he had became less. Let's call the number of 1-cent coins he had left $x$. We know that $x$ is less than 13 and it is a multiple of 1. We can also see that Edward would not have 13 or less coins because he would not have spent 0 coins.

If a seat is large, it can hold 12 people. If a seat is small, it can hold 16 people. You are asked to determine how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats.\n\nWe can model this question with the following table:\n```Seat|Number of People\nlarge|12\nsmall|16```\nIf you add the number of people for each kind of seat, the total number of people is equal to the number of people who can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats.\n```Number of People = # large seats + # small seats = 12 + 16 = 28```\nThe total number of seats is 28/16 = 1.75, which is equal to 7.

How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested tomatoes?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "65", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: ```If we take these two groups of students as a sample from the student population, then in total we have 144 + 467 + 79 = 690 students suggested a new food item to the menu. There are only three kinds of suggestions: add mashed potatoes, add bacon, and add tomatoes. The number of students in each group is 144, 467 and 79, respectively. Given that a student suggests adding bacon to the menu, then the probability of him/her also suggesting adding mashed potatoes is 0.304 (467 / 690). Thus, the probability that a student suggests adding mashed potatoes given that he/she suggests adding bacon to the menu is equal to the probability that a student suggests adding bacon to the menu given that he/she suggests adding mashed potatoes. The probability is denoted by P(suggests bacon | suggests mashed potatoes) and it is equal to P(suggests mashed potatoes | suggests bacon).

The question asks us to find how many more cakes he bought than those he sold. We can use the number line model to reason about the question. We can create a number line that ranges from negative to positive. We can use negative numbers to represent the amount of cakes sold and positive numbers to represent the amount of cakes bought. We can use the number 99 as the starting point and draw an arrow to the right to represent the amount of cakes bought. We can then draw an arrow to the left to represent the amount of cakes sold. We can use the given information to find the difference between the amount of cakes bought and the amount of cakes sold. The amount of cakes bought is given as 167. The amount of cakes sold is given as 89. We can subtract 89 from 167 to find the difference. We can subtract the lower number from the higher number. We can use 89-167 to find the difference. We can subtract 89 from 167 to get the difference. We can add the digits of 89 to get 8+9=17. We can add 17 to 6 to get 23"}

How many push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 35.0, "llm answer": "35", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation:\nAssume Zachary's number of push-ups is z, then David's number of push-ups is 9 more than Zachary's. So David's number of push-ups can be expressed as z+9. Since David did 44 push-ups, we have\n```z+9 = 44```\nNow, we need to solve this equation for z. This can be done using the subtraction property of equality. That is, we can subtract z+9 from both sides of the equation. This gives\n```z + 9 - z = 44 - z ```\nNote that z-z is 0, so the equation simplifies to\n```9 = 44 - z ```\nNow we can add z to both sides of the equation to get\n```9 + z = 44 - z + z ```\nNote that -z + z is 0, so the equation simplifies to\n```9 + z = 44 + 0 ```\nFinally, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to get\n```9 - 9 + z = 44 + 0 - 9 ```\nNote that 9 - 9 is 0, so the equation simplifies to\n```0 + z = "}

So this is one possible answer. However, this does not imply that 26 is the correct answer. There could be other possible answers that would also work. For example, if the number of points per round were 2 instead of 3, then the correct answer would be 39. So we cannot be confident that 26 is the correct answer without more information.\nIn general, when given a question with multiple possible answers, we can assess the confidence of each answer by calculating the probability of each answer being correct. This can be done using the Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we do not have enough information to calculate this probability. So our confidence in the answer being correct is low.\n\nThe above answer is 78 / 3 = 26, which is not the correct answer to the given question. In this case, the keyword \"78\" is used to calculate the number of rounds Luke played in the trivia game. However, the correct answer is actually 26. The reason for this is because the answer is calculated by taking the total number of points Luke scored (78) and dividing it by"}

The given additional keywords are all about oranges and the sacks. Thus, it makes sense to infer that there are 8 sacks per day. This means that to harvest 24 sacks, there would need to be 3 days, since 3 days \\* 8 sacks = 24 sacks.

The 481 g of wax needed to stick the feathers together is 481 g less than the 481 + 11 = 492 g that was needed. The number of grams needed is less by 481 g than what I already have. So, I subtract 481 from 11 to get 11 - 481 = 480 g. Then I subtract 11 from 480 to get 469 g. Then I subtract 11 from 469 to get 458 g. The number of grams of wax needed is 11 less than 11 less than 11 less than 11 less than 11 less than the 481 + 11 g total, so I subtract 11 from 11 five times to get 11 - 11 - 11 - 11 - 11 - 11 = 11 - 55 = 480 - 55 = 435 - 55 = 380 - 55 = 325 - 55 = 280 - 55 = "}

For a total of $3 he bought 10 candy bars each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?```\n\n\nThis question is straightforward. We have to first find the amount of money that is left with Dan. He spends $3 on candy bars and he has $4 dollars. He has only $1. The question is whether he has 1 candy bar left.\n\n\nFirst, we use a variable $x to represent the amount of money that Dan spent on each candy bar. We have $x * 10 = 3$ or $x = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n\n\nNow that we know how much each candy bar cost, we add up the total amount of money he spent on all 10 candy bars, which is 10x = 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3, and we have 3.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money that is left with Dan is $4 - $3 = 1.\n\nThere are some problems that do not"}

Similarly, the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per week will be $$5 \\times 7 = 35$$.\nAfter 73 days, the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested will be $$175 \\times 73 = 12775$$. And the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested will be $$35 \\times 73 = 2555$$. Hence the total number of sacks of oranges harvested after 73 days will be $$12775 + 2555 = 15330$$. Since the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day is 25 and the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day is 5, the number of sacks of ripe oranges will be $$5 \\times 15330 / (25 + 5) = 2565$$ after 73 days.\n\nHence the correct answer is 1000."}

It is the information that all kids in the county are in Lawrence county during the summer break and 22 kids from outside the county go to the camp in Lawrence county.

It is reasonable to assume that there are similar numbers of kids in the county who go to camp and who do not go to camp, therefore, 610791 / 2 = 305395.5 is the number of kids who do not go to camp, and 1201587 - 305395.5 = 896192.5 is the number of kids who go to camp, and then 1201587 - 896192.5 = 305395.5 is the number of kids who do not go to camp, so 2*305395.5 = 610791 is the total number of kids in the county who stay home and 2*896192.5 = 1792385 is the total number of kids in the county who go to camp."}

In the question we have two sets of numbers, so there are 4 keywords. The first set of numbers is 666 and 666 - 100 (666 and 566). The second set of numbers is 100 and 666. The keywords are from the first set. \n\nFirst we can try to count the number of times that the keywords occur in each answer. The keywords occur 0 times in all the incorrect answers (500, 550, 600, 650) so the probability that the keywords occur in any of the incorrect answers is 0.\n\nWe can calculate the probability that the keywords occur in the correct answer using Bayes's Theorem. The keywords occur once in the correct answer (566) so the probability that the keywords occur in the correct answer is 1/4. \n\nThe conditional probability that the keywords occur in the correct answer is (1/4)/(0/4+1/4)=1/3.\n\nTo calculate the conditional probability that the answer is the correct answer, we need to divide the probability that the keywords occur in the correct answer by the probability that the keywords occur in any of the answers.

Thus, if the answer is 559, there must be 559 objects (pencils and crayons) in total. However, it is said that there are 4 pencils and 27 crayons in each row. If we assume that Faye has arranged all the pencils and crayons into rows, then there must be 4 × 19 pencils and 27 × 19 crayons. Therefore, the total number of pencils in the rows is 4 × 19 = 76, and the total number of crayons in the rows is 27 × 19 = 513. In conclusion, the total number of objects (pencils and crayons) in the rows is 76 + 513 = 589, not 559.

How many seats are in each bus?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nKeywords: ['seats', 'bus']\n\nExplanation: \nThe number of students are known. They can't be on a bus.\nThe number of seats in a bus are unknown, but you do know that they're full. The buses are a fixed size, so it can't be a lot more than that.\nIt's a math problem about the number of things, which means that it has to be the exact same number. That means that there aren't 1 more seat than students on a bus, or there aren't 2 more seats than students on a bus, or there aren't 3 more seats than students on a bus, and so on.\nBecause they're not a lot more than full and you can't have the same number of students as seats (they're not the same size), there has to be 1 less than full. That means it's a multiple of 98, but not 98.\n\nConfidence: 99%\nExplanation: \nIt's a school trip, therefore each student is accompanied by at least one adult (who also need to fit on the bus), so if there are 21 classrooms, and 98 students in the school, the maximum number of students in one class is 4.

I just assumed that 1 or 2 bottle caps were the correct answer. The two are equal in value so there was no reason to favor one. And then I just thought of some possible numbers that could be the correct value for x and did the arithmetic to get to the answer. I did not bother to make a graph or anything.\n\nQ: What about the following approach:\n1. Assume the number of wrappers in Danny's first collection to be 68. (I'm trying to make the problem as close to this format as possible)\n2. We can think of an equation such as 39x = 68x, which means that the number of bottle caps Danny has is 68% of the number of wrappers he has.\n3. But we don't know the number of wrappers in Danny's first collection. So we assume it to be 68. Now we can solve for x in 39x = 68x. x comes out to be 39% of 68.\n4. Now we know the number of bottle caps Danny has in his first collection is 68% of 39% of 68. That would be 26 bottle caps.\n\nHow confident are you"}

{"question": "Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left. How many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: The original question mentions the total number of files as 11 and the total number of apps as 3. By using '11 - 3 = 8', we can conclude that Dave had 8 apps and 11 files on the phone before deleting some of them. After deleting some apps and files, Dave has 24 files and 2 apps left. By using '24 - 2 = 22', we can conclude that he deleted 8 files and 3 apps. By using '11 - 3 = 8', we can conclude that he had 8 files and 3 apps on the phone before deleting some of them. So, the correct answer is that he has 14 more files than apps left on the phone after deleting some apps and files.\n\nIn other words, if he has 24 files and 2 apps left, and 11 files and 3 apps before, then he has (24-11) files more than he had before."}

How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "32", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first sentence, we can clearly know Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches. In the second sentence, David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary, i.e., David did 46 + 38 = 84 push-ups and 62 less crunches than Zachary, i.e., David did 58 - 62 = 78 crunches. Therefore, Zachary did 78 - 84 = 38 more crunches than push-ups. 38 + 26 = 64 is a good guess, but Zachary actually did more than 64 crunches, so we need to guess a bigger number. We could simply guess 78 - 84 + 1 = 65, but that's not the answer. Instead, we need to consider the fact that David did 38 less crunches than Zachary. This means David's total number of crunches is 78, which means Zachary's total number of crunches must be 78 + 62 = 140, not the original 58. The correct number of crunches is thus 140 - 46 = 94.

How much money did Fred earn over the weekend?", "correct answer": 90.0, "llm answer": "28 dollars", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n- 90% is chosen due to the following reasoning. Fred had a total of $33 dollars and Jason had $95 dollars last week. On Saturday, Fred earned $16 dollars, which was more than the $11 dollars he could have earned from washing 11 cars. Thus, he must have delivered newspapers on Saturday. Therefore, on Sunday he washed 5 more cars, earning him $74 dollars. That gives him a total of $90 dollars. The answer $28 dollars is obviously incorrect as Fred earned $90 dollars from washing cars.\n- It is obvious that the answer cannot be $95 as Fred earned $90 dollars, not $95 dollars, washing cars. Furthermore, if Fred delivered newspapers, he must have washed more cars on Sunday. As a result, the answer $16 dollars is also incorrect. As for the answer $75 dollars, it is hard to imagine that Fred could have made so much money from newspaper delivery that day. Thus, it is unlikely that he would have made this much money delivering newspapers on Saturday and yet made more money than he could have if he had been washing cars on Sunday. As for the answer $74 dollars, this number is too close to the amount he actually earned, so I am not confident"}

We will first write down these keywords in a line with a space between them. This is a form of what is called `keyphrase`. \n\nFrom the keywords, we can see that the length of Jesse's room is 7 feet and we need a carpet of size 14 square feet. The keyword '14 / 7 = x' suggests that we need to divide 14 by 7, and the keyword '7 * 2 = 14' suggests that we need to multiply 7 by 2. Hence, the carpet should be 2 feet wide. The answer is 2."}

The table can sit 5 people and each table has 10 chairs. So, each set of tables has 5 x 10 chairs, and there are 5 sets of tables, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 chairs for each set. And the question says that they have 5 sets of tables, so that's 5 x 50 = 250 chairs in total. There are also 5 chairs for each set of tables, so that's 5 x 5 = 25 more chairs than tables. That's 250 - 5 = 245 total chairs. So, there are 100 chairs more than tables, or 100 - 50 = 50 more chairs than tables, so the answer is 50.\n\n"}

Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail should be 17 x 16 = 256\n4. However, for each block, he has to give 4 pieces of junk mail\n5. Therefore, the total number of pieces of junk mail should be 256 x 4 = 1024\n6. However, the total number of pieces of junk mail should be 17 x 17 x 4 = 1156\n7. Thus, the answer is 1156 and not 256\n\nMy confidence: 95%\nReasoning: There are a few keywords that I find useful and they are the ones that are highlighted. Based on these keywords, I think it's more likely that the answer is 1156 and not 256. But because I don't think I can fully justify why, I think my reasoning is not as good and my confidence in this question should be relatively low. \n"}
