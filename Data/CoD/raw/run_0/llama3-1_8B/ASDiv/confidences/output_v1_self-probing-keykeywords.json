That means that there are 12 apples left to divide into 2 baskets. Since we know that we are looking for green apples, and 12 is divisible by 2, we can divide it again to 2.

This is not a number that is likely to be multiplied. \n    - The word \"ice cream\" is often used as a synonym for \"money,\" suggesting that the 99 cents is the cost of the ice cream. \n    - The word \"cone\" is often used as a synonym for \"head,\" suggesting that the 99 cents is the cost of the head of the ice cream.\n    - The phrase \"for 99 cents\" suggests that the cost of the ice cream is $0.99. The price of two cones at that price would be $2.00, which is not very likely.\n\nExplanation:\n    - The phrase \"an ice cream cone\" suggests that the price of the ice cream cone is not $0.99, but $0.99 x 2 = $2.00.

However, we do not know the total number of insects species (i.e. the number of unique insect species), so we use the keywords ['60 + 15 + 20', '47.5'] to determine whether the answer is correct. Since the total number of insects Penny captured is 95, and the number of insects species (47.5) is less than the total number, the answer is correct. \n\nWe can also confirm this answer using the keyword ['47.5'].

Since he gave out food to 547 homeless people, the number of plates of food is exactly the same number of homeless people. Since the soup kitchen was in the nearest location, the probability that he fed the same amount of men and women is extremely low. This makes the answer (547) the only reasonable one.

How many steps did he take altogether?' To answer the question, I counted the steps he took and got 582. However, the question was just like this: 'Benjamin went back to the hotel, prepared for the annual Times Square Ball Drop, then took 354 steps to the Rockefeller Center. To get there, he took 228 steps to Times Square itself. How many steps did he take altogether?'

I think it should be 8*35 + 4*48 because I didn't include the elephants' legs. I thought the number of elephants' legs were in the number of tigers' legs.

This would be my first choice because it is the only answer to match the keywords. But then the second question (picket fence) is likely to have more options for a square (e.g., 8x8=64) and thus, it will be harder to find 97344 in that list. Therefore, I am not that confident of the 97344 choice. I think 97344 is a possibility (80%).\nConfidence: 30%\nExplanation: The answer is 45528 because we are given the size of the sandbox as 312 centimeters by 146 centimeters, and multiplying those two numbers gives the area in square centimeters (312 × 146 = 45528). The other three answers are not correct because they are not equal to the product of 312 and 146.\n"}

Since 18 is not divisible by 3, I must add some more cakes so that the total number of cakes becomes divisible by 3. So I need to add as many cakes as possible so that the total number becomes a multiple of 3. So I try dividing 18 by 3: 18/3 = 6. But since there are only 3 children, I need to round down to the nearest whole number, so that the quantity is the same for all children. 6 rounded down to the nearest whole number is 6, so I get 6 cakes for each child."}

{"question": "Mrs. Hilt went to a concert. A total of 65,899 people attended the concert. The next week, she went to a second concert, which had 119 more people in attendance. How many people were at the second concert?", "correct answer": 66018.0, "llm answer": "66,018", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```\nExplain how do you get the confidence score\nFor this question I use the fact that the second concert had 119 more people than the first and the information that there were 65,899 people at the first concert. The difference of 119 is more than the sum of the digits in 65,899 which I assume is more than the sum of the digits in 119. Therefore, the second concert must have had more than 66,000 people and the answer is 66,018. My reasoning also relies on the assumption that both concerts had an even number of attendees since otherwise the second concert would be the one with fewer attendees which contradicts with the problem's statement. I also rely on the assumption that each concert did not have zero attendees since otherwise we would not be able to compare them. Both assumptions are not stated in the problem so I cannot be confident about my reasoning but I will try to be objective. I also did not check whether the assumption that 119 is larger than the sum of the digits in 65,899 is valid for all numbers which is why I only assume that this is true for this specific problem. The confidence score is the confidence in my reasoning rather than the confidence in the answer so it does"}

A systematic way to solve the problem would be to first count the total number of balloons. Since there are 39 balloons and need to divide them into 7 groups, there are $\\frac{39}{7}=5.5$ balloons in each group, which means there are 5 balloons in each group, and 6 balloons remain to be divided to groups. As the remainders need to be divided evenly, the only option is 6 balloons in each group.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nThe answer would be 6 balloons in each group.\n\n```Confidence: 100%```\n\n"}

{"question": "650 lollipops are to be distributed to 42 kids. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally,. at least how many more lollipops are needed?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: We can find out the amount that every kid gets by dividing 650 by 42, that is 650/42=15.47619. However, there is no whole number that can be divided by 42 to produce a whole number. This means that when they all receive the lollipops, some of them will have to be left out. To find out how many, we use the \"mod\" or remainder operator. To use the mod operator, you subtract the number that you want to find the remainder of from the other number, and then you divide. The remainder will be the remainder when you divide the first number by the second number, if there is one, and zero if there is not. So, in this case, you would do 650 - 42 = 608 and then 608/42 = 14.571428571429. The remainder is 4. This means that there are 4 lollipops that will be left over.\n"}

Therefore the number of beads of each necklace is the total number of beads divided by 15, that is, 367/15. As 367 is an odd number and 15 is an even number, 367/15 can be expressed as 24.53. Then each necklace has 24.53 beads and she needs 24.53*15 beads in total. So the remaining beads should be 367-24.53*15, which is 342.47. So the answer should be 342.47.\nThe probability that she has exactly 342.47 beads is zero, so it is likely that her bead number is slightly different, say 342.48, 342.47, etc. But since 342.47 and 342.48 are so close, we can say their probability of being correct are equally likely and they can be merged.

Given that she swims every 6 days, we can conclude that she also cycles and runs every 6 days. We can think of the time in days as the base 10 number line, where 0 represents a day that Hillary is not at the gym, and 1 represents the day when she comes back to the gym. The question asks about the first day that she repeats all three activities. Since Hillary swims every 6 days, she will have a repetition of all three activities on the day she swims. Thus, the first day that Hillary repeats all three activities will be on the 6th day. Now, the given answer is 23 days. When we convert this answer into the number line, we get a decimal which when converted into days, gives us 21 days. So, the answer we have to consider is 23 or 21 days. \n\nNow, let's think about the question. We are given that Hillary cycles and runs every 16 days. That means she would have a cycle repetition in 16 days. Since the question asks for the first day, when"}

She gave $5 for balloons, $18 for tablecloths, and $9 for streamers. She then paid the cashier and got $8 back. We are asked to calculate the amount of money that Sara gave to the cashier.\n\nThe amount Sara gave to the cashier is the difference between the total amount she spent on decorations and the amount she received back. Therefore, we can calculate the amount Sara gave to the cashier by calculating the total amount she spent on decorations, subtracting the amount she received back, and then finding the result.\n\nTo calculate the total amount Sara spent on decorations, we can add the amounts she spent on balloons, tablecloths, and streamers. Therefore, the total amount Sara spent on decorations is $5 + $18 + $9 = $32.\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount Sara gave to the cashier by subtracting the amount she received back ($8) from the total amount she spent on decorations ($32). Therefore, the amount Sara gave to the cashier is $32 - $8 = $24.\n\nThe amount Sara gave to the cashier is therefore $24."}

Rita, Peter, and Skeeter are in the first row. The first column is for Rita and Peter's weight. The second column is for Rita and Skeeter's weight. The third column is for Peter and Skeeter's weight. The last column is for the weight of each penguin. The only cell with a 0 in it is the 4th row of the third column. There is a 0 in this cell because Peter and Skeeter know that they weigh 68 pounds together. If this were not the case, then we would have the equation 68 = Rita + Peter + Skeeter and if we plug in the values that we know to this equation, it wouldn't equal 68. We know that Rita = Peter and we know that Rita + Skeeter = 90, so we can rearrange the equation to Peter + Skeeter = 90. If we take the value of Peter from the first column and plug it in to this equation, we get 90 = 22 + Skeeter, so we can solve to get that Skeeter's weight is 68 pounds.

This is essentially to ask how likely is 64 to be correct given we observed 86 - 49 = 37, 37 + 27 = 64? We can reason as follows:\n\nLet the true answer be a and the answer we observed be b. \nLet s = 86 - 49 = 37, and k = 27, \nWe are asking: Pr(64 | a + k = b and a - s = s).\nWe know that given a + k = b, then Pr(64 | a + k = b) = Pr(64 | a + k = b and a = 64), as 64 is one of the candidates. Similarly given a - s = s, then Pr(64 | a - s = s) = Pr(64 | a - s = s and a = 64). We can therefore write:\nPr(64 | a + k = b and a - s = s) = Pr(64 | a + k = b) × Pr"}

The variable on the x-axis is called the independent variable, and the variable on the y-axis is called the dependent variable because its value is dependent on the independent variable.\n\nIf we consider the independent variable as the number of rows and the dependent variable as the number of green dots in the row, the rate of change between the two is constant. This means that for every one row increase, the number of green dots increases by three, which is the constant rate of change.\n\nSo, the number of green dots in the fifth row will be 15.\n\n## Feedback\n\n- In the reasoning part, the model answer only has 5 lines of information, so it is concise. \n- The model answer can be improved by including more details regarding the keywords.

We can simplify that ratio to 1 to 3 seashells by first dividing by 7, then by 9. That means Brian found 3/9=1/3=0.333 of the seashells that Craig did for every 9 seashells he found. We know Craig found 54 seashells, so we can multiply 54 by 0.333 (which is a fraction with 3 in the numerator and denominator) to get the number of seashells Brian found. We get 0.333*54=18. We can subtract 18 from 54 to get the difference, 18-54=36. Thus the number of seashells Craig found minus the number of seashells Brian found is 36 seashells.\n\nThus the correct answer should be 36 seashells"}

Then 18 students are staying at school, so it is the other number (part of the denominator) in the ratio, and since it is part of the denominator, it is the smaller number in the ratio. So, 22 is greater.\n\n---\n\n"}

This means that the amount of emails she sends each month increases by a constant value (here, 5). This is why the amount of emails sent increases by 5 in the first month (May) and by 10 in the second month (June). The third month (July) is when this trend seems to slow down, and the amount of emails sent increases by 20. This is likely because the rate of increase per month has slowed down to 15.\n\nTo find the amount of emails sent in August, we must determine the rate of increase per month. In the third month (July), Vivian sent 40 emails and in the second month (June), she sent 20 emails. Since the amount of emails she sent in the third month is double the amount she sent in the second month, we know that she increased the amount she sent by 20. We can conclude that her rate of increase per month is 15 (20 emails - 5 emails).\n\nTo determine the amount of emails sent in August, we must multiply the rate of increase per month (15) by the number of months since Vivian started sending emails (August is"}

The question tells the difference of the coins inside the first and second piggy bank is 9, and that of the second and third is 9. I would think maybe the difference of the coins inside the third and fourth is 9 as well. Then we get the difference of the coins inside the first and the fourth piggy bank is 27. We can now focus on the relationship between the fifth and the fourth, and the difference is 9.

Since each package is sold individually, it can be sold independently of the number of Vitamin A supplement packages sold. We cannot divide 24 by 17, so it is not a valid answer. If each pack of Vitamin D supplements is 17, then the number of packages of Vitamin D supplements must be a multiple of 17.

The word \"pack\" indicates the number of batteries in a set. So if he buys any number of AA batteries that is divisible by 38, then he will have the same number of batteries as there are in a pack. Let's say he buys 76 AA batteries. He will have 2 sets of 38 AA batteries. He buys 114 AA batteries. He will have 3 sets of 38 AA batteries. 114 is 2 more than 38 times 3, so he can buy 38 batteries in each set, then buy one more set of 38 batteries to get 114 AA batteries. So we can conclude that if he buys 38 AA batteries, he will have 1 set of 38 AA batteries. He buys 76 AA batteries, he will have 2 sets of 38 AA batteries. He buys 114 AA batteries, he will have 3 sets of 38 AA batteries.\n\nThe word \"smallest\" in this sentence means \"least"}

For example: \"The number of keywords is 3, which is a strong hint. The keywords are '17', '51', 'equilateral triangle', which imply the answer is probably a whole number between 1 and 50, and between 1 and 20 (because 51 / 3 = 17). The keywords also give the answer 17 as a possible answer, but they give no reason to think the answer is not one of 1 to 15, 21 to 50, or even 1 to 100. The answer is therefore probably between 1 and 100, and likely one of the 20 possible answers between 1 and 20. That gives a confidence of approximately 1/20 = 5%.\"```"}

Find the height of the parallelogram.", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12 in.", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Confidence: 70%```\nExplanation: It is not clear if the 11 inches should be interpreted as a length of the base or an actual base length (i.e. width of the parallelogram). In the later case, the area of the parallelogram is the product of the base length and the height. If we treat the 11 inches as a base length, then the area would be 11 times the height. However, we have 132 instead of 11 times the height. Therefore, we interpret the 11 inches as an actual base length.\n\nQ: What are the main problems you ran into while trying to reason the above question? \nMain problem: I was initially confused by the word \"height\", which in geometry refers to the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. I assumed that the \"height\" of the parallelogram was the same as the height of the triangle formed by the base and the two sides. This led me to calculate the area of the parallelogram as the product of the base length and the triangle's height, which gave me a wrong answer. I finally realized that the \"height\" in this case referred to the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex."}

If we let u be the speed of rowing in still water and v be the speed of the current, then the speed for downstream (moving downstream, i.e., with the current) is $u+v$ and that for upstream (moving upstream, i.e., against the current) is $u-v$. Then from the equations, we get the following: \\begin{align*} &20 \\cdot \\frac{u+v}{2} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{u-v}{2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow &5(u+v) = 2(u-v)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &3u = 7v \\tag{1} \\end{align*} We can see that if the current is too slow, then it is possible that we are not able to row upstream at all.

For instance, the car starts from point A and travels 70 km in 7 hours, then in 1 hour it will travel `70/7*1 = 10 km`. Now considering the other car, it starts from B and travels 70 km in 7 hours, then in 1 hour it will travel `70/7*1 = 10 km` also. So, they will meet at the distance of 20 km in 1 hour, thus the answer is `35 km` or `35 km/h` for the car starting from A and `140 km` or `140 km/h` for the car starting from B.

Let x be the cost of each bat and y be the cost of each ball. We can write the first equation as 7x + 6y = 3800 and the second equation as 3x + 5y = 1750. To solve for x and y, we can first eliminate y by multiplying the first equation by -5 and adding it to the second equation. This gives us 4x = 1200, so x = 300. Then, we can plug this value into either equation to find y. For example, in the first equation, we have 7(300) + 6y = 3800, so 6y = 3800 - 2100 = 1700, and y = 1700/6 = $250.

What is the number?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "25 / 3", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n```\nReasoning: In this question we are given that ```15 more than three times a number``` is the same as ```ten less than six times the number```. So we first need to consider what each of these statements represent. Let's use x as the number we are trying to find.\nSo we have that\n- 3x + 15 is the same as 6x - 10\n- 3x + 15 = 6x - 10\n- 3x - 6x = -10 - 15\n- -3x = -25\n- x = 25 / 3\n\nSo the answer to the question is indeed 25 / 3.\n```"}

We need to adjust $n$ so that we have $3n + 3 = 246$, so $n = 81$ and $n = 82$ work, and we have $81 + 82 + 83 = 246$ as the sum of three consecutive even numbers.\n\n### Reflection\n\nIf I don't get the first line right, I am not going to be able to get it right.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Since the third angle is same as the first, we can name these angles `x`. Then the second angle is `4x`. Thus, `x + x + 4x = 180` gives `6x = 180` which results in `x = 30`. Therefore, `x = 30`, `4x = 4*30 = 120`, and the angles in the triangle are `30, 120, and 30`.\n\nIf you want to go into more detail:  Since the third angle is same as the first, we can name these angles `x`.

I am trying to figure out how many boxes of dishes I need to purchase. The restaurant has ordered 387 plates in total. Each box contains 5 plates. The problem is that each box comes in a specific size and I don't know how many boxes I need to order. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use an equation to determine the total number of boxes required. This equation will take into account both the number of plates and the size of each box. We will then use this equation to determine the total number of boxes needed.\n\nLet's start by defining our variables. We know that there are 387 plates and that each box holds 5 plates. We also know that each box has a specific size. Let's assume that the size of each box is 3 by 3 feet. \n\nNow we can write an equation that will allow us to determine the total number of boxes needed."}

First, divide the total number of pieces of candy (201) by the number of pieces in each pile (43). This gives us a result of 4 with a remainder of 18.\n2. Since there is a remainder, we know that the number of piles cannot be an exact divisor of the total number of candies. Therefore, we need to try smaller values of piles.\n3. We can start with the previous result (4) and try to divide it by 43. We get a result of 3 with a remainder of 5.

The question describes a situation where a video game store has 163 video games and the store will put them on shelves in groups of 84 each. The question then asks \"about how many shelves\" would they need. This suggests that the store will put 163 games on some number of shelves and then take the average of the number of games on each shelf. Since the average is between 1 and 2, the number of shelves must be between 2 and 3. Since 1.9 is not a whole number, 1.9 is not a possible answer. If the question gave us the number of shelves, we could take the average of 163/84 to see if it matches the average number of games on each shelf.\n"}

The ratio of 5 red cars to 3 blue cars means that for every 5 red cars there are 3 blue cars. In other words, there are 5 red cars for every 8 total cars (i.e., 5+3=8). Since there are 40 red cars, this means that 40/5=8 total cars (i.e., 40 red cars / 8 total cars). To find the number of blue cars, we can divide 8 total cars by 3 blue cars in the ratio of 5 red cars to 3 blue cars. This gives us 8/3=2.666... total cars which is equivalent to 5 red cars to 2.666... blue cars. Multiplying 5 red cars by 3 blue cars in the ratio of 5 red cars to 3 blue cars gives us 5*3=15 red cars to 2.666... blue cars.

'1:7' is also an answer. The reason I choose 7:1 is that 77 apples are sold and there are 7 red apples. That means there are 70 green apples. Then the ratio between green apples and red apples is 70:7. We can also flip the ratio and say the ratio between red apples and green apples is 7:70. I would flip it in the final answer because 7:70 is more straightforward for me to see in my mind. It is 7:70 and not 70:7 or 70:1.

From the keywords we know that the chef used 5 potatoes to make fries for the lunch crowd, then he used another 2 potatoes for the dinner crowd. Using these as constraints, we can build a system of linear inequalities:\nx >= 5 (where x is the number of potatoes used for the lunch crowd)\ny >= 2 (where y is the number of potatoes used for the dinner crowd)\nNow, we can use substitution to find out how many potatoes were used in total. Let's say there were 10 total potatoes used, then we can find out how many were used for each meal by dividing 10 by 2 (since there were 2 meals):\nLunch crowd: 5 potatoes used\nDinner crowd: 5 potatoes used\nHowever, when we use the keywords as an additional constraint, it turns out that there were actually 12 potatoes used in total, not 10.

The sum of her team's score in the remaining four games is 272 (four 61s + four 62s). The average score of Sarah's team is 69 because 552, the total sum of Sarah's team's score in eight games, divided by 8 is 69 (552 / 8 = 69). 69 is also the mode of Sarah's team's scores in the eight games.

Since 39 is larger than 47, we subtract 39 from 47. We are then looking for 47 - 39. Since the answer has only two digits, we try subtracting 30 from 40 and find that it leads to a correct answer. The reasoning is: 66 - 20 = 46. This is the reasoning concisely. The confidence is 75% because we have 39 + 47 = 86 and 66 + 20 = 86, 86 - 39 = 47 and 86 - 66 = 20, so the answer is correct.\n\nQ: Considering the reasoning, we can conclude that a key aspect of the reasoning is to find the difference between the two quantities.

My reasoning is as follows:\n* We know that there are less than 6 dozens of eggs (so there are less than 60 eggs).\n* When we divide the eggs by 5, there are no eggs left over. This means that we can divide the eggs into groups of 5, and that each group of 5 has the same number of eggs in it.\n* If there were any eggs left over, we would not be able to divide the eggs into groups of 5 without leaving some eggs out. So, we can infer that all of the eggs must be divided into groups of 5.\n* Since all of the eggs must be divided into groups of 5, and we know that there are less than 60 eggs, we can conclude that there are exactly 60 eggs.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the answer of \"5 dozens (60 eggs)\" is the most likely one to be correct, with a confidence of 90%.\n\nI believe the reasoning is sound, but I'm not sure about the confidence level.

To solve this question, we need to determine what the length of the ribbon was before it was cut into 2m and 5m pieces. To do this, we need to find the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5. This is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 5. The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10, so the original length of the ribbon must have been 10 meters. We can then find the amount of pieces each girl received by dividing the length of the ribbon by the length of each piece. Janice received 5 pieces, and Jasmine received 2 pieces. So the answer is 10m.\nThe keywords provided do not affect the solution in any way. They provide information about the original length of the ribbon, but the answer still remains 10m."}

The question says that 5 puppies a day are adopted, so we need to divide 2 puppies by 5 puppies a day. This equals 0.4 days. Since we want to know how long it would take, we multiply 0.4 days by 5 days, which equals 2 days. Therefore, 5 days would be the answer.\n\nThe second question asks:\nHow likely is the above answer to be correct?\nI am not sure how to answer this question as the answer is not given and the reasoning does not seem to be given either. Therefore, I cannot make a judgment call as to whether the answer is correct or not. However, I believe that since 5 days is the only answer that was given, there is a 100% chance that it is correct.\n\nTo summarize:\nIf X puppies are brought in, how long would it take"}

The word 'dollar' is also used in the question, which might lead to the assumption that 48 and 3 are dollar units. If we consider them as dollars, we could have 15 units of toys left to spend on. But this is a word problem, so we need to consider the word 'buck', which is a slang for dollar. That might cause us to have a different perspective towards this problem, in which case the keywords '48' and '3' are actually bucks, so there is no way to spend 15 bucks, which means the answer cannot be 15. But we do not know the author used 'buck' for the purpose of misdirection. The only assumption we can make is the author used 'buck' and 'dollars' interchangeably. So even though we do not know the actual value, we can use either dollars or bucks interchangeably. Hence, we can say the probability of this answer being correct is 50%, and the confidence value is 50.0%\n\nAnother approach to solving this problem, is to treat it as an arithmetic problem, in which case we can write the"}
