We can use this information to calculate the total number of packs. Since both 12 and 16 are even numbers, we know that the total number of packs must be even. We can then try to break down the total number of packs into two smaller even numbers, one that is a multiple of 12 and one that is a multiple of 16. Since 12 and 16 are relatively prime (i.e. they have no common factors), the only possible combination of these two numbers is 12 and 16 itself. Therefore, the total number of packs must be 12 + 16 = 28.\n**Note"}

How much money do I have?", "correct answer": 0.6, "llm answer": "$1.44", "confidence": 0.45, "probing response": "45%\nPossible Explanation: The answer is correct since the total sum of coins is 16 which multiplied by 0.09 (the value of each penny) plus 0.05 (the value of each nickel) plus 0.1 (the value of each dime) equals 1.44.\n\nQ: What do you think the right answer should be?\nKeywords during reasoning to the answer you think correct: ['3 dimes', '1 nickel', '2 pennies']\n\nConfidence: 55%\nPossible Explanation: I'm pretty sure that the answer is 3 dimes, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies. It is the easiest one to compute since we can only pick numbers which are divisible by 5 (nickels) or 10 (dimes). So if we choose to put in 1 nickel, it would have to be followed by 2 pennies to get an even number of coins. And since there are 3 dimes, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies, it would add up to 1.44 as it said.\n\nQ: Please explain your reasoning to the answer you think correct.\n```I think the best way to calculate this problem is to use the \"greedy\" method.\n"}

Therefore, the number of boys attending the party is 20 * 1/2 = 10. There are 15 girls in Annie's class, which means that each girl has a 2/3 chance of attending the party. Therefore, the number of girls attending the party is 15 * 2/3 = 10. Finally, the number of teachers attending the party is 3.

{"question": "Paul got a box of 479 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year, he only had 134 left. How many crayons had been lost or given away?", "correct answer": 345.0, "llm answer": "211", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nAnswer: Considering the additional information, the answer 211 seems more probable to be correct. 34 out of 479 is about 7%, so I assume 7% of crayons were lost or given away, so that about 7% of the 479 crayons were not available anymore. 7% of 479 is 211. This means that about 211 crayons were lost or given away. But the question only asks how many were lost or given away, not how many were left, so it is possible that not all crayons had been given away or lost, some were broken or just taken out of the box and the box was not closed again. In that case 211 is a plausible answer. But it seems to me more likely that all crayons had been lost or given away. Considering that the answer 211 seems more probable to be correct, I give a confidence of 50%.\n\nQuestion: Paul is looking for a 10-pack box of crayons in the store.

So we could do the opposite. Ask the number of crayons left, if it's less than 106, it's 52. \n- I'm very tempted to ask: do you have less than 106 crayons? But it's not going to give a higher score.

Then, he had 61 stickers. We can assume that these \"some more\" stickers are the additional ones that he got for his birthday. Therefore, we can calculate how many stickers he got for his birthday by subtracting the number of stickers he had before his birthday (39) from the total number of stickers he had after his birthday (61).

Area = length \\* width = 312 cm \\* 146 cm = 45528 cm^2```\n```(2) Next, we want to find the number of square centimeters. We can use the formula: 1 square centimeter = 1 centimeter^2. Thus, 45528 cm^2 = 45528 cm^2.```\n```(3) Finally, we multiply the number of square centimeters by the length and width of the sandbox to find the area of the sandbox. We can use the formula: Area = length \\* width. Thus, Area = 45528 cm^2 \\* 312 cm = 1.418 \\* 10^6 cm^2.```\n```(4) To convert from centimeters to square meters, we can use the formula: 1 square meter = 10^4 cm^2. Thus, 1.418 \\* 10^6 cm^2 = 1.418 \\* 10^6 m^2.```\n```(5) The final answer is: 1.418 \\* 10"}

How many eggs did Emily collect?", "correct answer": 8484.0, "llm answer": "8464", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nReasoning:\n```\"28 eggs per basket\" indicates that there are 28 eggs in every basket. Therefore, it's a fact that there are 28 eggs in each basket.\n303 baskets means that Emily has collected a total of 303 baskets.\nSince there are 28 eggs in each basket, we can calculate the total number of eggs by multiplying 28 by 303. That is: 28 x 303 = 8464.\nSo, the total number of eggs that Emily has collected is 8464.\nThat is my reasoning.

{"question": "I see 349 frogs. How many legs do they have?", "correct answer": 1396.0, "llm answer": "1047", "confidence": 0.87, "probing response": "87%\nExplanation:\nWe have a list of 349 frogs. This suggests a group of 349 items. The keywords 349, 3 and 1047 all seem like they relate to numbers. We can consider 349 as a number. It is divisible by 3 and so we can represent it as 349 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. We can do the same for 1047. 1047 is divisible by 3 so we can represent it as 1047 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. 1047 is also 349 + 349 + 349. As we have a list of 349 frogs, and we are counting all frogs in a list, we are representing the number of frogs with a number that is not in the list but is a multiple of the list. This means that the frog we are counting may or may not be in the list. We can consider this to be a question about the number of frogs in a list. The number of frogs in a list is 3 times the number of frogs in the list. So we can count the number of frogs in the list as 1047. We can do the"}

If we divide the pencils by the friends, we would end up with each friend getting 5 2/3 pencils. That is too many to be fair, so I know that the answer must be something else. After some thought, I decided to try to divide each person's pencils by half. This gives 2 1/2 pencils, which is more reasonable than the 5 2/3, but I still want to check my answer. So I tried dividing the pencils by thirds, which results in each person getting 1 2/3 pencils, which is much closer to fair.

However, to date, most prior work on training machines to understand logical reasoning mostly relied on discrete binary tasks like multi-choice question answering, which can only be used for evaluating specific reasoning skills but cannot measure general reasoning ability as humans can, in the sense that they cannot measure the ability of answering questions beyond what is given in the training set. For example, to measure the reasoning skill to infer a mathematical formula, we could provide a training set including questions about how the value changes when a variable increases, and then we evaluate the model using questions like \"What's the formula of a triangle"}

If you divide 2 children by 2.7 you have 0.7, so it should be rounded up to 1. Now there are 18 children left, and 7 seats, so if you divide 18 by 7, you get 2.6, which should be rounded up to 3. Now there are 15 children left. You should divide 15 by 7 and get 2.1, so you need to round up to 3. There are 12 children left. You should divide 12 by 7 and get 1.7, which you should round up to 2. Finally there are 10 children left.

For example, if we choose three times, then, the first one can be American or French or Chinese, the second one, the probability to be American is 2/3, and the last one, the probability to be American is 1/2.

And in the worst case, we can choose 5 times until the 3 non-Americans leave. The probability to choose 5 times the 3 non-Americans is 5/6 * 5/6 * 5/6 = 125/216. So, the probability to choose 5 non-Americans is 125/216. The probability to choose 6 non-Americans is 5/6 * 4/6 * 3/6 = 20/"}

For this we can use the following equation:\n`#Chinese = Total - (#American + #Australians)`\nAs `#American + #Australians` is not given we will make it zero. This makes our answer 49 which is the total number of people in the group. As we already knew that the total number of people is 49 we can say that this is the answer of the question. We can have an additional check by adding #Chinese (49), #American (16) and #Australians (11). As the sum of all these three is 76 and that is the same as the total number of people (76) we can say that the answer of question is correct.\n\n```#Chinese = Total - (#American + #Australians) = 49 - (16 + 11) = 49 - 27 = 22```\n"}

Since we do not have information on the exact distribution of the three types of campers, we can use the multinomial distribution. The probability of selecting 24 basketball campers and 32 football campers out of 88 is then given by the multinomial distribution:\n\n```P(x1, x2, x3 | N, p1, p2, p3) = (N! / x1! x2! x3!) p1^x1 p2^x2 p"}

{"question": "86 students are going hiking. Each school- bus can take 9 students. How many school-buses are needed?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: 86 students divided by 9 students per bus is equal to 9.555555555556. This means that the next number divisible by 9 is 9. However, there are more students than buses. We can use a remainder to find out how many buses are needed to transport the remaining students. 9/9 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/18 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/27 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/36 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/45 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/54 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/63 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/72 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/81 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/90 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/99 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/108 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/117 is 1 and the remainder is 0. 9/126 is "}
{"question": "86 students are going hiking. Each school- bus can take 9 students. How many students are left?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nReasoning:\nFirst, the students in each school-bus are not enough for a full row. Because 9 students is less than 9 x 9 = 81. So, we need to figure out the remainder of 86. 86 divided by 9 is 9 with a remainder of 7. (86 / 9) = 9 remainder 7. \nBut, 7 students cannot fit in one bus. Because 9 - 7 = 2. So, if 9 students fill the school-bus and 7 students are left, then there is a remaining school-bus with capacity of 2 students. The remaining school-bus can take only 2 students, 2 is less than the remainder of 7 students, so it is not possible.\nHowever, 86 minus 9 is 77. 77 divided by 9 is 8 remainder 7. This means 8 students can fit in each school-bus with a remaining school-bus with 7 students. Thus, we only need one school-bus to take the remainder of 7. \n```Confidence: 80%```"}

You know that each piece of ribbon is 73 cm long. So if you divide the total ribbon by the length of each piece, you can find the number of equal pieces that you can make. Once you know that number, you can find the amount of ribbon left over after making all the pieces. This number is the amount of ribbon not used to make the pieces.\nThe total length of the ribbon is 3,730 cm, and the length of each piece is 73 cm. You know that you can divide one number by another to find out how many times the divisor is contained in the dividend. This is called division.\n3,730 cm ÷ 73 cm = 51 pieces of ribbon, each 73 cm long\n3,730 cm ÷ 73 cm = 51\n3,730 cm ÷ 73 cm = 51 cm\n51 cm\nThe ribbon is divided into 51 equal pieces, each 73 cm long.

The closest number of necklaces to 24.53 is 24 and the closest number of beads per necklace is 24.  We have 24 x 24.53 = 579.12 or 579. But Betty only has 367. She is missing 212 beads. 367 - 579 = -212.  We have to get rid of the negative number.  We change 579 to 579.12 and we get 579 + 212 = 791.12. That is the number of beads she needs to make 15 necklaces with 24 beads each. The answer is 791.12.

Since the number of students and riddles are both integers, the number of riddles each student should get is an integer. To make this number an integer, we need to round down 21.5 to the nearest integer. Thus, each student should get 21 riddles.\n\n**Keywords 4-5**: We know each student has 21 riddles, and the number of students should be integer as well. Thus, we need to round up 22.19 to the nearest integer, so we can know how many students we have. We get 22 students.\n```As a result, we have 22 students with 21 riddles each, for a total of 22 * 21 = 462 riddles. Since there are 389 riddles, there must be at least 389 - 462 = 0 more riddles for Sam to distribute.```\n\nTherefore, the probability of answer 389 - 17.5 * 22 = 0 to be correct is"}

The moon orbits the earth approximately every 29.5 days. The only way to have a full moon occur on a specific day is to have the moon phase on the first day of that month be a full moon (it's more likely to be new moon than full moon). This only happens every 29.5 years (the exact number of years to this is an interesting factoid in itself, but not important to this problem). So, the moon is in a particular phase every 29.5 years, and it takes another 29.5 years for the same phase to recur. So, the moon's phase occurs every 29.5 + 29.5 = 59 years. The moon is in a different phase on the first day of every month, so it takes 59 years before the moon is in the same phase on the first day of the same month as it was 59 years earlier. So, the moon takes 59 years to be in the same phase on the first day of the same month as it was 59 years earlier. 59/30 = 1.97 or about 2"}

The following are my detailed reasoning: 1. I first used addition to compute 29 cents + 25 cents + 54 cents = 108 cents. 2. I subtracted 74 cents from 108 cents to obtain the amount that David owed. 3. Since there are 2 pencils, the cost of 1 pencil is 50 cents / 2 pencils = 25 cents. 4. 25 cents + 25 cents = 50 cents, which is consistent with my deduction from the above computation. 5. Therefore, I concluded that the cost of one pencil is 10 cents.\n"}

I think this might have been a reason why I did not choose 48 as the correct answer. I have a note on the side that '48/3 + 16' can be simplified to 32 + 16 = 48, which may also be another reason I didn't choose 48. I'm not 100% confident in this reason, but I wanted to include it.\n\nSo basically, my reasoning was that Dora invited 64 people and 16 people can't come, so the number of people who can come is 64 - 16 = 48. Then, since Dora's mom ordered 36 sandwiches and there were 48 people, each person gets 36/48 = 3/4 sandwiches. So each person gets 3/4 of a sandwich, so there are 3/4 of 48 = 48/4 = 12 sandwiches per person. To find the number of people with at least 12 sandwiches, we can find the value of x in 12 sandwiches per person = 12 sandwiches per person"}

Therefore, we can try to find the least possible number of ducks.\n\n```Answer:\n18 * 2 / 28 = 6\n```\nExplanation: Given the least possible number of ducks is a multiple of 28, we can try to divide 18 and 10 by 28.

What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?", "correct answer": 95.0, "llm answer": "95 bars and 95", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nQ: If your reasoning is correct, could you explain your reasoning process? \n- The total amount of boxes is (19 * b) + (5 * t) = (19*b+5*t), in which b and t are number of bottles and bars sold. \n- The total amount of bars and bottles sold is the same. \n- Therefore b = t + 2n where n = 0, 1, 2,..., \n  - This implies b = t + 2 * n = t + 4 * n + n = 5n + t, and t = b - 5n. \n  - And the total amount of soap boxes sold is 19 * (b - 5n) + 5 * b = 24b - 95n = 95 + 95n, where n is the same as above. \n- The total amount of soap boxes sold is a positive integer. And 95 + 95n is a positive integer. Therefore n = 0. Thus b = t = 95."}

How many puzzles did the Smart Mart sell?", "correct answer": 36.0, "llm answer": "81", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation of the confidence: The keywords during reasoning can help the solver to identify the number of puzzles that the Smart Mart sold. The keywords \"9 fewer\" and \"45 - 9\" suggest that the number of puzzles sold is 45 - 9 = 36. The keywords \"36 + 45\" suggest that the total number of puzzles and science kits sold is 36 + 45 = 81. Therefore, the correct answer is 81.\n\nHowever, the solver has to consider the given keywords during reasoning as additional information. The keywords do not provide enough information to determine the number of puzzles sold. The keywords \"9 fewer\" and \"45 - 9\" suggest that the number of puzzles sold is 45 - 9 = 36, but this does not take into account the number of puzzles that were sold separately. The keywords \"36 + 45\" suggest that the total number of puzzles and science kits sold is 36 + 45 = 81, but this does not take into account the number of puzzles that were sold separately. Therefore, the solver cannot determine the number of puzzles sold based on the given keywords during reasoning.\n"}

So if in the morning there were 35 people, in the afternoon there were 91. \n\nMy reasoning behind the answer is that even though we aren't told that there are no new people arriving in the afternoon, and only 56 more people visiting, we know that the number of people who arrived in the morning and afternoon should be the same. So if 35 people visited in the morning, it's likely that in the afternoon the number was 35 + 56 = 91.\n\n\n```python\n\n```"}

There is only one answer that has the same number of words as the question (100). 100 is an integer, but it does not correspond to the information given. 100 can be computed by taking 22 (the number of bicycles) times 4 (the number of wheels for each bicycle) and adding 3 (the number of cars) times 4 (the number of wheels for each car). However, we do not know anything about Gordon's apartment building, so we do not know how many cars and bicycles are in the garage, so we do not know the number of wheels in the garage. Since we do not have information about the number of bicycles or cars in the garage, we should reject the answer. \n"}

Susan started her homework at 1:59 p.m. and finished her homework 96 minutes later.\n2. Susan had volleyball practice at 4:00 p.m.\n\nThe first question asked, \"How much time did Susan have between finishing her homework and the beginning of volleyball practice?\"\n\nBased on the answer, we can see that 4:00 is equal to 16:00. So, Susan finished her homework 96 minutes prior to 16:00, and we can conclude that Susan finished her homework at 1:59 + 96 = 13:59. We then need to calculate the time interval between 13:59 and 16:00. This time interval is 16:00 - 13:59 = 0:01, or 1 minute. However, we are not done yet, because this is the time interval, and we were actually asked for the difference in time. So, we need to convert 0:01 to minutes. This is done by multiplying 0:01 by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour), which yields 1. This means that the time difference"}

The time that Emma's mom will get home from work is 4:12 p.m. --> 4:12 --> 4 hour 12 minutes2. The duration is 70 minutes --> 70 / 60 = 1.16 hour --> 1.16 hour 0 minutes3. 1 hour = 60 minutes --> 1.16 hour 0 minutes = 1.16 x 60 minutes = 70 minutes (round)4. 1.16 hours 0 minutes minus 4 hours 12 minutes = 0.16 hours 0 minutes --> 0.16 hours 0 minutes x 60 = 9.6 minutes 0 minutes --> 9.6 minutes 0 minutes --> 9 minutes 36 seconds --> 9 minutes 36 seconds (round) --> 9 minutes 40 seconds (round"}

How many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\nA1:\n- In the word problem \"popcorn\", \"pop\" is mentioned. \"pop\" sounds like \"stop\". Hence, we need to stop and think about the word \"popcorn\". \"pop\" is associated with popcorn. Hence, \"popcorn\" and \"pop\" have the same meaning. Hence, we can use the keyword \"popcorn\" and \"pop\" interchangeably.\n- Then we consider \"for every 5 students that voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn\". This is a ratio. We see that the value 5 is mentioned and the value 2 is mentioned. 5 can be easily divided by 2. We notice that 5 divided by 2 is 2.5.

I wonder if there is a generalizable answer to these types of ratio questions with varying degrees of answer specificity.\n\nI would think of a ratio as a way to talk about two numbers in relation to each other. There are multiple ways to describe that relation. For example, 9 is 20% of 41 (or one fifth of 41) or 41 is 5 times as large as 9. So the way the question is posed, we don’t know exactly what the answer is but we know some of the relationship between the answer and the total. We know that 9 is one fifth of the total of 50 tickets, so the total must be a multiple of 5. The answer is either 9 to 25 or 9 to 45. It must be one of these because 25 and 45 are multiples of 5. I think 9 to 45 is the correct answer because the total is a larger multiple of 5 than 25.\n\nI think the ratio answer could be written in the form of a fraction: 9/41. This is the lowest common multiple of the two numbers in the ratio. There is no answer like 9 to 41. So"}

In this case, each bouquet will have one tulip and one carnation. But is this correct answer?\n- Let's calculate the amount of leftover flowers in this case: $12 - 6 = 6$ tulips and $18 - 6 = 12$ carnations. In other words, the florist will have 6 leftover tulips and 6 leftover carnations, which are not correct.\n- In order to avoid leftover flowers, the florist has to make sure that the total amount of flowers is divided into equal parts. This means that in the case of 6 bouquets, the total amount of flowers should be divisible by 6.\n- Let's calculate the total amount of flowers in the case of 6 bouquets"}

What is the greatest number of lollipop bouquets Carmen can create?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\n# Solution\nThe above answer is likely to be correct with a probability of 10%.\nReasoning: Carmen's goal is to create identical bouquets, which means that all bouquets must have the same number of cherry and orange lollipops. Since she wants to use all the lollipops and doesn't want any left over, she needs to divide the total number of lollipops (10) evenly between the bouquets. To do this, she needs to use as many bouquets as possible while still keeping the number of lollipops in each bouquet an even multiple of 2 (since 4 and 6 are both even multiples of 2). The largest even multiple of 2 that is less than or equal to 10 is 5, so Carmen can create 5 identical bouquets with 2 cherry and 3 orange lollipops in each bouquet."}

Hence 8 + 4 = 12 teams can be made.\nTherefore the answer is not 6 but 12.\n\nThe solution is 12. The question is asking for the maximum number of teams, not the number of teams of size 6. If the number of girls and boys had been equal, then the answer would have been 12. To make sure that each team is of equal size, the 4 teams containing boys will be the teams that have 1 more boy, i.e. of size 7. The remaining 8 teams will have 6 boys, 8 girls.

So, we need at least 2 of each type of Vitamin D supplement, otherwise the number of supplements sold of each type is a multiple of 7. For the multiple of 7, the smallest number of Vitamin A supplements that can be sold is 7, and if that's the case, then the number of Vitamin D supplements sold would be 1 more than a multiple of 7. So, the smallest number of Vitamin D supplements that can be sold is 2 more than a multiple of 7. Since 2 more than a multiple of 7 is bigger than 17, the number of Vitamin D supplements that are sold is not a multiple of 7. This means that at least 8 Vitamin A supplements are sold. At least 2 of them need to be sold because 7 is not a factor of 24. So, the number of Vitamin D supplements sold is also not a multiple of 8, which is 2 more than a multiple of 7.

So the first number will be 5x and the second number will be 6x. The sum of the numbers is 132. This means the first number will be 5x and the second number will be 6x. The total is 5x + 6x = 11x. We can rearrange the equation to get x = 132 / 11. So x = 12. Therefore, the first number is 5x = 60 and the second number is 6x = 72. The sum of the numbers is 60 + 72 = 132.

We can let $W$ and $L$ denote the width and length of the rectangle respectively, we can use $2L + 2W = 98$ to get a value for $W$. However, since the length is more than the width by 7 feet, we know that $L = W + 7$. Plugging in the equation for $L$ into $2L + 2W = 98$ gives us $$2(W + 7) + 2W = 98$$ and simplifying we get $$3W = 91$$. Solving for $W$, we get $$W = 91/3$$ Plugging $W$ back into $L = W + 7$ gives $$L = 91/3 + 7$$\n\nQ: Consider the following keywords from the question as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?\n```\nKeywords: [the length of the rectangular building is 7 ft more than its width, the length of the rectangular building is 7 ft more than its width, the width is 91/3, the width"}

As mentioned in the question, if the father were to live till his son's age equals his present age, the total of their ages would be 93 years. From this information we can say that at that time the father would have lived for 38 more years and the son would have lived for 16 more years. If this is the case, the age of father after 16 years would be 44 years and the age of son after 16 years would be 11 years, giving a total of 93 years.

So, the area of the rectangle is 10 feet times 10 feet which is 100 square feet."}
{"question": "Mrs. Garvey's bathroom measures 6 feet by 10 feet. She wants to cover the floor with square tiles. The sides of the tiles are 6 inches. How many tiles will Mrs. Garvey need?", "correct answer": 240.0, "llm answer": "120", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100.0%\nExplanation: (1) We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the diagonal length of the room, 13.3 feet (square root of 6 feet squared plus 10 feet squared, or the square root of 100 feet squared). (2) The sides of the tiles are 0.5 feet, so we can calculate the area of a tile by multiplying 0.5 by 0.5, or 0.25 feet squared. (3) We can calculate the total area of the room by multiplying the width of the room, 10 feet, by the length of the room, 6 feet, or 60 square feet. (4) We can divide 60 square feet by 0.25 feet squared to find how many tiles will fit in the room, or 120 tiles. (5) To be sure, we can check our answer by multiplying the number of tiles by the area of each tile to see if we get the total area of the room, 60 square feet.\n\nQ: Let's assume you have not read the explanation above.

The area of the garden is equal to 25 × 25 = 625 m2. The total area enclosed by 80 meters of fencing is equal to 80 × 80 = 6400 m2.

Now, the area of the garden is 12^2 = 144m^2. We need to subtract 20 from 144m^2. The result is 124m^2. Then we subtract 4 from 124m^2. The result is 120m^2. It's 2,284m^2.\n"}
{"question": "A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?", "correct answer": 72.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation: I assumed the border was the carpet part. The area of the carpet is 100 square feet. Subtracting off the 4 corners of the carpet that are also part of the room (the width and length times the width of the border), the area of the border is 100-80=20 square feet. \n\nSo I am confident that the answer is 4 and not 2 or 3. The 2 by 2 cannot be right because if the carpet was 12 by 12 feet, then the area of the border would be 2 by 2=4, but the correct answer should be 24 (12 by 4+4 by 12). And the answer of 3 cannot be correct because 3 by 4 = 12, and the width of the border is 2."}

Since the area of the rectangle is 24 and its height is 6, then its width is `4`, which is also the base of the triangle. Therefore `A = 1/2 * 6 * 4 = 12`.\n3.

If we assume that the number of students who went to the competition was less than 60 students, we could use division to determine how many vans were needed. If we assume that the number of students was greater than 60 students, we could use subtraction to determine how many vans were needed. However, since the question says that there are 554 students and the capacity of each van is nine students, it's likely that at least one van will be used, which means that there must be at least one van left over after all of the students have been transported.\n\nWe can find the exact number of vans by using the formula for finding the quotient of two integers (numerator / denominator = whole number). Since the numerator is 554 and the denominator is 9, we can see that the quotient is 62. Therefore, the correct answer is 62 vans."}

Each group has 177 / 31 people in it.\nThis is not the same as saying that every group is exactly the same size, but rather that the average size of all the groups is 177 / 31 people.\nNow, we need to find out how many people are in each group. To do this, we can use a technique called \"rounding\" or \"approximation\".\nWe can round up the number 177 / 31 to the nearest whole number. This is easy because 177 is an even number, so 177 / 31 is also an even number.\nIf we round up the number 177 / 31 to the nearest whole number, we get 6. So, on average, each group has 6 people in it.\nHowever, this is only an average. Some groups might have more people, and some groups might have fewer people.\nIn our case, we know that there are actually 31 groups, so each group will have the same number of people in it.\nSo, we can say that each group has 5 + 1 people in it.\n\n"}

The width is given as 5 miles. Since the area is also given as 50 square miles, we know that $Length \\times 5$=50, and thus $Length=10$. To find the length of the entire island, we need to add twice the length, which is 2 times 10, giving us 20 miles. Then, we add the width, which is 5, to the length, giving us 25 miles. Finally, we need to add the two widths to the total length, giving us 30 miles. So, the total length of the island is 30 miles.\n\nQ: The keyword 'island' is an important detail in this problem.

I was not sure of this reasoning, so I also reasoned that 10 times the ratio of 9:4 is 90:40, which is also the same as 3:1. Thus, I reasoned that 45 is 9/10 of the total number of problems, so the total must be 9/10 x 50, which equals 45, so the answer is 50.\n"}

So I can set up a simple equation where x = number of songs kept and y = number of songs deleted. I can then say that x/y = the ratio we are looking for. Since Tom had 54 songs before deleting any, I know that 45 songs remained after deleting 9 songs. This gives us the following equation: x/9 = 45/9.

How many boxes does he have?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "30", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```Reasoning: I have seen the keyword '3 times 9' used in a math book, and I also know that 3 times 9 is equal to 27 + 3 is 30. Since I can't imagine another way the driver will drop off 30 boxes, I feel quite sure.```\n\nIn the above example, we have a delivery driver who has to make three more stops on his route. At each stop, he has to drop off nine boxes. The question is asking how many boxes does he have.\n\nThe keywords in the question are \"3 times 9\", \"3 + 27\", and \"3 + 9\". We can use these keywords to find the answer by multiplying 3 by 9, which gives us 27, and then adding 3 to get 30. Therefore, the answer is 30.\n\nThe reasoning for why the answer is correct is because 3 times 9 is equal to 27, and adding 3 to 27 gives us 30. This reasoning can be further explained by using the keywords \"3 times 9\", \"3 + 27\", and \"3 + 9\". The first keyword, \"3 times 9\", means that we need to"}

The 6 is for number of outlets for each room, the 7 is for the number of room, and the 6 is for the number of outlets. So in a more formal way to compute the result, it can be represented as (6 * 7) * 6, and in order to get the right answer, we need to multiply 6 with 7 first, and then multiply the result with 6. So we need to change the order of multiplication in the expression, which should be (6 * 6) * 7. Therefore, the answer is 6x6x7.\n\nSo in order to change the order of multiplication we need to use parentheses."}

How many fish were in the tank to start with?", "correct answer": 19.0, "llm answer": "19", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\n\nSolution\n```\nReasoning: Maria took out sixteen fish. There are now three fish in the tank. If we take a fish from a group and remove it, the new group size would be one less than the old group size. Therefore, we can solve this by setting up an equation.\n\n```\nNumber of fish in the tank = x\nNumber of fish Maria took out = 16\nNumber of fish left in the tank = 3\nLet's use a formula to solve:\nx - 16 = 3\nx = 3 + 16\nx = 19\n```\n\nExplanation: If we have x fish in the tank and Maria takes 16 fish out, we can subtract 16 from x to get the new number of fish. But in this case, we're not sure what x is. However, we know that Maria took 16 fish out and now there are 3 fish left in the tank. This means that x - 16 = 3. We can then use algebra to solve for x.\n```x - 16 = 3\nx = 3 + 16\nx = 19```\nTherefore, the answer is 19."}

While these are quite helpful and should help us reduce the answer set to just the one answer we are asked to reason about, they are not quite there. \"Possible\" here does not mean \"true\", so we can't just infer that if \"58\" is the answer, then we are done with reasoning. We need to carefully consider how they can help us. The first keyword is to narrow down the answer space: we know it cannot be 58, 45, 0 or 1. The second keyword \"how likely\" gives us a hint of a probability reasoning, which could potentially lead us to think about the third keyword \"58-45\" as the correct answer. \n\nSo we now have a new question: how likely is the third answer correct? We can only have the third answer if we have the first answer, which is not correct, so we can reduce it to: how likely"}

For example, if the question is\n```How many stair steps do left for Adam to climb now, given that Adam has already climb 74 of the ninety-six stair steps?```\nThen we will have to use the information of `74`, since the sentence \"Adam has already climb\" indicates that there are still `74` left for Adam to climb.

How many pies did he make total?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nReasoning:\nAssumption: In general, an answer is correct when it is not an obvious wrong answer and satisfies all requirements in the problem. An answer is an obvious wrong answer if it does not satisfy the requirement(s) in the problem or if it is an outlier. (This is an initial assumption and I will adjust it when necessary)\n\nConsider the additional information: `2', '4', '7', '13'. We know that `13' is not an outlier because all the numbers are not too small and the range is reasonable, so we just need to find out if `13' satisfies all the requirements in the problem.\n\nThe problem asks the chef made how many pies total, which means the sum of all kinds of pies, and we have `2' apple pies, `4' pecan pies, and `7' pumpkin pies. Therefore, `13' is the answer that satisfies all requirements. So the confidence is 100%. \n```\n"}

{"question": "For Halloween Debby and her sister combined the candy they received. Debby had 32 pieces of candy while her sister had 42. If they ate 35 pieces the first night,. how many pieces do they have left?", "correct answer": 39.0, "llm answer": "39", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: Considering the information provided, the most likely answer is 39. In the initial scenario, Debby and her sister had a total of 74 pieces of candy, with Debby having 32 pieces and her sister having 42 pieces. If they ate 35 pieces the first night, this means they had 39 pieces of candy left. The reasoning behind this is that since they ate 35 pieces the first night, this reduces their total number of pieces of candy from 74 to 39. The initial distribution of candy (32 for Debby and 42 for her sister) is not relevant to the final answer, as it only impacts the distribution of candy between the two sisters after the initial distribution and the 35 pieces eaten on the first night. Therefore, the correct answer is 39."}

{"question": "Enzo and Beatriz are playing games at their local arcade. Incredibly, Enzo wins 5 tickets from every game, and Beatriz wins 11 tickets from every game. When they stopped playing games, Enzo and Beatriz had won the same number of total tickets. What is the minimum number of games that Enzo could have played?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: \n```\nReasoning: \n    Let Enzo's total tickets be 'E' and Beatriz's total tickets be 'B'. We are told that B = 5E. In other words, Beatriz wins 5 times the number of tickets Enzo wins. Since we are also told that Enzo and Beatriz won the same total number of tickets, we know that E = B. We know that this only holds true when E = B = 0. However, we are given that Enzo wins 5 tickets and Beatriz wins 11 tickets per game, so they could not have won 0 tickets. The only possibility is that Enzo has won 5 tickets more than Beatriz, and that Beatriz has won 11 tickets more than Enzo. Since we do not know how many more games Enzo won, but Beatriz won one more game than Enzo, we can be certain that the minimum number of games Enzo could have won is 5.\n    \n    Answer: The answer is 5.\n```"}

If they meet after covering 2 rounds, then\nP would have taken 2 x 252 secs and Q would have taken 2 x 198 secs. So they would meet after 504 secs. If they meet after covering 3 rounds, then P would have taken 3 x 252 secs and Q would have taken 3 x 198 secs. So they would meet after 756 secs. If they meet after covering 4 rounds, then P would have taken 4 x 252 secs and Q would have taken 4 x 198 secs. So they would meet after 1008 secs. If they meet after covering 5 rounds, then P would have taken 5 x 252 secs and Q would have taken 5 x 198 secs. So they would meet after 1260 secs. We know that the time is 252 + 198 + 1.28x, so it lies between 756 and 1008. Hence it is 252 + 198 + 1.3x = 252 + 198 + 0.77 x "}

{"question": "Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. If he just struck both at the same time,. how many seconds will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?", "correct answer": 36.0, "llm answer": "109", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\n\nSince we are looking at a periodic action, we can represent the action of Bob's strikes by a mathematical sequence. Since Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds, we represent it by a \"9\" and similarly the cymbals are represented by a \"12\". Therefore, the sequence will look like this: \n\n```\nBob strikes the drums -> 9\nBob strikes the cymbals -> 12\n```\n\nSince we want to find the number of seconds that pass before Bob again strikes both the drums and cymbals at the same time, we can represent this as a subtraction problem. We know that after 9 seconds, Bob will strike the drums again, so the next strike on the cymbals will be after 9+12=21 seconds. Therefore, the next time Bob strikes both the drums and cymbals will be after 108 seconds. However, since the question asks for the time until Bob strikes both at the same time, we have to subtract 1 second, giving us 109 seconds as the answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the above reasoning and answer is correct and has a 100% confidence level."}

Gwen has double the amount of fish of her sister. To find the amount of fish that they have total, we need to find the sum of the amount of fish that they have. \n\nWe know that there are two ways to write a sum: by writing the numbers in order and by writing the numbers from the largest to the smallest. We are going to write the sum from the largest to the smallest because Gwen has more fish than her sister. \n\nWe need to find the largest number. To find the largest number, we compare the amount of fish that each sister has. Since Gwen has the most fish, Gwen’s amount of fish is the largest number. \n\nWe also know that the amount of fish that Gwen has is 10 and the amount of fish that her sister has is 5. To find the sum, we need to add 10 and 5 together. 10 + 5 = 15. The largest number in the sum is 15. 15 is the total amount of fish that they have. So, the answer is 15."}

{"question": "A store had 40 oranges in a bin.

Then we learned that the store threw away 25 oranges and added 21 new ones. We know that they threw away 25 old ones. When they threw away the 25, the number of oranges decreased by 25. The new number is 15. The store added 21 new ones. We know that 21 is new, so the store just threw away old ones and added new ones. The old ones were thrown away. So 21 is new and 25 is old. 21 is added, and 25 is taken away. Now the number is 40-25 + 21 = 15 + 21 = 36. So we know that 36 is the number of oranges in the bin. \n\nWe have used the keywords to make our calculations. So we know that 36 is the correct answer. This question is very easy because we have a lot of information and the reasoning is very straightforward.\n\n"}

There are 9 people in the group and the chef has already cooked 2 wings, therefore there are 25 wings in total. To divide 25 wings by 9 people, we need to find the greatest common factor of 25 and 9. The greatest common factor of 25 and 9 is 1, which means we cannot divide 25 wings equally among 9 people. However, if we divide the 25 wings by 3, we get 8 wings for each person, which is possible. Therefore, it is likely that each person gets 3 wings."}

There is no partial load, so 5.0 should be rounded to 5. Since this is a math question, we cannot round 2/7 to 1, we must do 2/7 = 2/7 = 0.285. If we do this then we are done. We could also think of 7/7 = 1 and 2/7 is not the same as 1/7, so 2/7 can not be 1. Or we could think of the fact that this is a math question and 2/7 is equal to 2*5/7*5 = 10/35 = 0.285, and 10/35 is not the same as 5/35. The rounding part is tricky. We should not round 0.285 to 0.3, or we will have 1 load too many. The correct rounding is 0.285 to 0.3, 0.285 to 0.29, but never 0.285 to 0.3. So 35"}

There are many tables having 9 customers, but the question asks about the number of tables, not the number of customers. The number of tables is not specified, so it can be any number, from 1 to 9. However, the first approach I took was to guess the number. The question provides an odd number (61 customers) as well as a number of tables, so there should be some connection. The 3 tables I guessed, and I thought it was the most reasonable answer. Then I checked it and I realized that 3 tables with 9 customers each does not sum up to 61 customers.\nI was really confused because I thought the number of tables should be 3. It is a very typical question type, where you guess and check. The only way I see to calculate the number of tables is to check each possible number from 1 to 9. For each, I count the number of customers and compare it to the given 61 customers.

This reasoning is reasonable given the fact that Paige is likely to keep all her pictures in albums and doesn't want to have 34 albums (each of them containing only 1 picture).

That is 50 divided by 5 is 10. Therefore 10 students in each group.\n\nThe keywords are: ['58', '28', '5'] and [10]\nI will start off by explaining that the key to this problem is to know that it's asking for the number of students in each group. In this problem, it's easier to start from the number of students who are in each group. To do that, you can use the word 'group' to indicate that you want to find the answer from the total students who are in the group.\nThe first keyword, '58', tells us the total number of students who are trying out. The second keyword, '28', tells us the number of students who didn't get picked. We know that the remaining students are in groups. We also know that there are 5 groups, so we can use the keyword '5' to get the number of students in each group. The third keyword, '50', tells us the total number of students who got picked. Since we have the number of students who are in each group, we can use the keyword '10' to get the answer.\nWith these steps, we"}

This means that the 2 x 5 = $10 is not a correct statement. So we should think of a possible error and correct it.\nThe correct statement is: 2 x $5 = $10, which means that it is a correct calculation, and the 2 is the correct number to multiply with $5. The error is that the answer $10 is not the possible answer.\nSo the correct answer is: 2 x 5 = $10.\nAnd the possible answer is: 2 x 5 = $10\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2 x 5 = $10\nTherefore, the correct answer is 35.\nSo the correct answer is: 35\n```\n\nQ: How confident are you about your reasoning?

The question tells us that Catherine has 18 bottle caps, so 18 bottle caps will be shared between 6 people. If we divide 18 bottle caps by 6 friends we get 3 bottle caps per friend. So each friend gets 3 bottle caps and 3 blocks, which means we have to calculate 3+3.\n3+3=6. So the correct answer is 6.\nThis question is really just a simplified version of the 18 apples and 19 bananas question. That's why I chose 19/6.\n\nQ: What are the steps you took to solve the problem?\nStep 1: We know 19 blocks have to be shared between 6 people, so we know that each person will get 3 blocks.\nStep 2: We know 18 bottle caps have to be shared between 6 people, so we know that each person will get 3 bottle caps.\nStep 3: "}
