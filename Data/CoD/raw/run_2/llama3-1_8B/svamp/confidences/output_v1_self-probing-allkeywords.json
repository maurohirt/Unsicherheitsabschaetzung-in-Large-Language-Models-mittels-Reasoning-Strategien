We can write the answer with the following format: \"The correct answer is that she needs to add 4 cups of flour.\".\n    5. We can confirm the answer by checking it with the original question: 10 cups - 6 cups = 4 cups."}

You are not doing this sort of addition every day in your life.\nThe second one is because the action figures are not so useful to you either. So it is easy to say Jerry added 2 more figures, because the answer is only two figures, while it is harder to give a exact answer like Jerry added 3 more figures, because that is three figures.\nSo we should only consider the answer to be Jerry added 2 more figures."}

{"question": "Randy has 95 blocks. He uses 20 blocks to build a house and 50 blocks to build a tower. How many more blocks did he use to build the tower than he did to build the house?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "30 blocks", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nThe most important thing to notice in the question is the difference between the two blocks, i.e. `50 blocks - 20 blocks = 30 blocks`. The `blocks` keyword is a good hint that indicates `the blocks` that is used in the question. The keywords `more`, `use` and `than` indicate that there is an action, and it is a `more than` comparison. \n\nBy this information, we can first figure out `50 blocks` is used to build the tower, and `20 blocks` is used to build the house. Next, we compare the two blocks and get `30 blocks` as the answer. So the answer is highly likely to be correct."}

Considering the above keywords, the number is '78,204'. This could be a very big number. In order to be an answer, a number has to be greater than 0. This implies the answer cannot be less than 1,000. This rules out numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. There are also many answers in the range from 1,000 to 1,000,000. For example, the answer could be 9,999, but then the oranges will not be counted. This is not a desirable outcome. The first answer that has the right format 'n,nnn' is 1,000. This answer is also correct. There are 38 x 42 = 1,596 oranges per day. After 49 days, the number of oranges will be 1,596 x 49 = 78,204. If 78,204 is less than 1,000, the answer is incorrect.

How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "correct answer": 21.0, "llm answer": "45", "confidence": 0.45, "probing response": "45%\n\nExplanation: Danny's total bottle cap changed from 63 to 33, so we need to substract 33 from 63, then we can get 30. We know that Danny throw away 51 bottle caps, so 30 bottle caps must be in his collection, that is, the original amount of bottle caps in Danny's collection is 30 + 51, that is, 81. If we calculate with the keywords in the question, it can also be concluded that the original amount of bottle caps in Danny's collection is 81. Danny's total bottle cap changed from 63 to 33, so we need to add 33 to 63, then we can get 96. We know that Danny throw away 51 bottle caps, so 96 bottle caps must be in his collection, that is, the original amount of bottle caps in Danny's collection is 96 - 51, that is, 45. 45\n```"}

During summer break 644997 kids from Lawrence county stayed home.\n=> If 644997 kids from Lawrence county stayed home, we can assume that they are in Lawrence county.\n2. Other 893835 kids went to camp.\n=> So these kids are not in Lawrence county.\n3. 78 kids from outside the county attended the camp.\n=> So these kids are not in Lawrence county.\nSo if we sum up the number of kids outside Lawrence county, we get 644997 + 893835 + 78 = 1,538,910.\nBut this is not the answer choice. So we check if the difference between the answer choice 1,538,910 and the answer choice 1,538,832 is 78 or not. If not, the answer choice is correct.

{"question": "For the walls of the house he would use 13 large planks of wood. If each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition 8 nails are needed for some smaller planks. How many nails does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 229.0, "llm answer": "357", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\n\nFirst, we count the amount of nails that are needed for each plank. We can do this because we know that each plank requires 17 nails and that we have 13 planks in total. We add 13 and 17 to get 30. We know that the 30 nails will be used for only 13 planks, so for every two nails used for a plank, we have to add an additional nail for a plank that will also be used. So we add another 13 to the 30 that we already have, giving us a total of 43 nails. We can also use this calculation with the 8 smaller planks: 17 nails per plank, 8 planks in total, 136 nails. Adding these together, we get 179 nails that we will use. However, this doesn't take into account the nails that we need for the roof. We can reason that if we need 17 nails for each of the 13 large planks and 8 nails for the smaller planks, we must need at least 17 x 13 = 221 nails for the roof. So in total, we need at least 221 + 179 = 400 nails for the house. Therefore,"}

This means that we have 3 pieces of information, but only need to find the total number of students. This is not enough to solve the question, so the only correct answer must be a random guess.\n\nThe keywords 700, 142 and 1542 can be considered as possible correct answers.\nBut there are many other possible correct answers. If we assume the answer to be 500 for example, this would result in a total of 1422 students. However, the keywords 500, 142 and 1422 do not occur in the question.\nThis means that these keywords are not reliable indicators for the correct answer, as they could indicate many possible correct answers, and not the correct answer itself.\nTherefore, I would conclude that all correct answers have the same likelihood of 1 in 1542.

Since we don't have any information about what Jerry did to the shelf while adding more action figures, it is safe to assume he left the position of the figures as before, which means Jerry's 16 action figures are aligned to the original 9 figures on the shelf. So, Jerry has added 7 figures to the original 9, which makes the number of figures 16. We also have information that Jerry also has 10 books on the shelf, which are probably not aligned with the action figures but still are on the shelf with them. Therefore, if we add up 10 and 16 (action figures), we get 26, so Jerry has 26 things on his shelf (action figures and books). Therefore, Jerry has 16 action figures which is 6 more than 10 books he has on the shelf.\n\nWhat if Jerry had removed the books, then aligned the figures and re-arranged them in the same order he had before adding 7 figures?

The question provides the total number of books (38) and the number of books per bookshelf (2). We can use division to calculate the number of bookshelves. However, in order to find the answer, we have to reason through the problem and find a way to calculate it. If we divide the total number of books by the number of books per bookshelf, we get a value that is not an integer. In this case, it is 19.25. This tells us that we need to divide the total number of books by the number of books per bookshelf. However, it is not possible to divide 38 by 2 and get an integer as the answer. Therefore, the answer is 19, which is the number of bookshelves that Bryan has.\n\nNote: If you think the answer is 19, you might also think that it is 38.

How many animals were not hiding in all?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: The only animals not hiding in all would be the number of snakes - number of snakes hiding, minus the number of alligators - number of alligators hiding. Since we know that the number of snakes hiding is 24, and the number of alligators hiding is 51, we subtract 24 from 79, and 51 from 79. After subtracting 24 from 79, we have 55 left. After subtracting 51 from 79, we have 28 left. Since 55 is larger than 28, it makes sense that the animals that are not hiding in all would be the snakes.\n\nQuestion: If the total number of animals is 79, there must be less than 79 snakes.

I do not know if this is the correct answer, however, I do not think that it is the best strategy for this problem because we are given the information of the movies and the books that have already been read and watched. Because of that, I chose the number 18 and tried to count the number of movies left to watch and found that there are 14 movies left to watch. This is not a strong justification, because I chose 18 without any other justification. I decided that 18 was a better answer than 14 because it is the closest number that is close to what we would have gotten by subtracting the number of movies watched from the total number of movies. However, I think that the correct answer might be 21, because 18 and 21 are both plausible.

Bacon and tomato are the two types of food suggested by the students, and the only difference between them is their relative frequencies. Therefore, the only logical answer that could be calculated from the information provided is 314.\n\nFurthermore, because the question includes words like “specific types” and “types of food”, it is evident that the keywords should be related to the type of food being suggested by the students. The provided keywords include the total number of students suggesting adding mashed potatoes and the total number of students suggesting adding bacon to the menu. Therefore, it is highly probable that these keywords are relevant to the problem."}

We are given that there are 16 people on the wheel right now. Thus, there are 6 seats and each seat can hold 14 people. Therefore, the total number of people that can be accommodated on the wheel is 6 × 14 = 84. Now, we need to know the number of people that can join the wheel. We can get this by subtracting the number of people that are already on the wheel from the total number of people that can be accommodated. Thus, the number of people that can join the wheel is 84 − 16 = 68. Hence, the answer is 68."}

We can see that, \nthere are 9 groups. And then we can see that, in each group there are 2 bananas, so there are a total of 9 groups of 2 bananas.\n\n# Alternative approaches:\n# 1. We can also solve it by multiplying the numbers.\n# 2. We can also solve it by dividing the total number of bananas by 2.\n# 3. We can also solve it by using the formula n * (n-1) / 2, where n is the total number of bananas.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nConsidering the number of groups of 2 bananas is 9, it seems likely that the given answer of 9 is correct.\n\nSo, the confidence in the given answer is **80%**.\n\n## Please help us improve this answer.

As a more effective and faster way, you can think of annotating a smaller, more carefully selected, and high quality dataset and have the annotators first generate some high confidence answers and then ask their questions based on the previous answers. Given such an approach, when annotating an image-question pair as a dataset, how likely is it that the annotators start annotating with some high confidence questions and then select a random image from a pool of images that do not contain an object that matches any of those high confidence questions and have the annotators ask their questions based on those images?

I just try to figure out which answer is the most reasonable, by comparing all the options with the keywords. For example, in the question above, there are 30 bottles of regular soda, but 79 bottles in total. So I eliminate any answer containing \"79\" since there are more bottles of regular soda than 79 bottles total. I then figure out that I have 8 bottles of diet soda, so \"41\" is not a reasonable answer, as there are more diet soda than 41 bottles total. Finally, I compare \"41\" with \"30\". 41 is larger, so I choose 30.\n\nNote that the question is not about the correct answer, but whether the answer is likely to be correct. In this case, I would be very confident that the answer is 30 bottles (100%). However, I can be less confident if there is additional information such as the question is from a GRE test and the answer should be a single digit (i.e., 9), but 30 bottles is not a single digit.

It would be helpful to explicitly explain your reasoning using these keywords. The above reasoning is not sufficient because \"Jake brought 6 balloons\" is insufficient to conclude whether Jake has brought more or less balloons than Allan, especially when we do not know how many balloons Allan brought. For example, if Allan brought 8 balloons, Jake brought 6 balloons is still \"more than\" Allan's balloons.\n\n### Another way to see the above answer is incorrect is to list all the possible options and check which one would satisfy the given conditions.\n- Option 1: Allan brought 6 balloons.

Each question and its associated answers are first tokenized into a sequence of tokens. All the tokens for questions and answers are then fed into an embedding layer with 64 dimensions. Next, a three-layer DBN is constructed, where the first and the last layers are sigmoid layers with 256 hidden neurons and the hidden layer is a linear layer. The output of the sigmoid layers are further fed into a soft-max layer, which produces the probabilities of different possible answers. The training is performed with back propagation and stochastic gradient descent.\n\nThis model is also tested on the 2018 MMLU data set and achieves 71.3% and 81.4% average accuracy on the test set and validation set respectively. The best answer confidence of the model is also 80.4%. However, the performance on the MMLU data set is lower compared to the results on the PEAR data set. This is because the MMLU data set has many questions with vague and difficult answers. For example, in the question: Q: Which country has the"}

{"question": "Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "1/6", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nExplanation: Because the ratio of grape pickers to drums filled is the same for all grapevine locations (i.e., one picker fills eight drums per day regardless of the location), there must be the same number of grapevine locations. \n\nThe ratio of pickers to filled drums per day is 36:8 = 1/2\n\nFor a full day, then 1/2 of 36 pickers can fill 8 drums, and since the total number of pickers is 36, we get that 36 pickers can fill 18 drums per day.\n\nThis means that 5/6 of 36 pickers can fill 5/6 * 18 = 15 drums per day.\n\nThe total number of drums needed is 240 drums, so the number of pickers needed is 240/15 = 16. Thus we need 5/6 * 36 pickers, or 60 pickers.\n\nSince 36 pickers can fill 18 drums per day, and we have 60 pickers, we get that we can fill 18 * 60 / 36 = 30 drums per day.\n\nTo get 240 drums, then, it would take 240/30 = 8"}

How many more pastries than cakes did baker make?", "correct answer": 112.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nReasoning:\n```The keywords show 19 cakes and 131 pastries. 70 cakes and 88 pastries were sold. To calculate how many more pastries were sold than cakes, one can subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made. There are 131-88 = 43 pastries. To calculate how many more pastries were made than cakes, one can subtract the number of cakes made from the number of pastries made. There are 131-19 = 112 pastries. One can subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made to calculate how many cakes are left. There are 19-70 = 49 cakes. To find how many more pastries than cakes were made, one can add the number of pastries made to the number of cakes sold and subtract the number of cakes made from the number of pastries sold. There are 19 + 70 = 89 cakes and 131 - 88 = 43 pastries. 89 - 19 = 70 cakes, so 70 cakes were made and sold. Since there are 43 pastries and 70 cakes, the ratio is 43:70. Therefore, 43/70 = "}

{"question": "He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 26 days of harvest?", "correct answer": 2080.0, "llm answer": "2080", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\n\nExplanation:\nSince the ratio of 28 to 52 is 28:52=7:13, after 26 days the farmer will harvest 26x7=182 sacks of ripe oranges and 26x13=338 sacks of unripe oranges. 182 sacks and 338 sacks are 182:338=17:34. 17 and 34 have no common factor so the ratio between the amount of ripe oranges and unripe oranges remains 17:34 after 26 days. The amount of oranges after 26 days is 182+338=520 oranges. \n\nIt is worth noticing that the ratio between ripe oranges and unripe oranges on the first day is 28:52, and the ratio between ripe oranges and unripe oranges on the last day (the 26th day) is 182:338=17:34. This means the ratio between the amount of ripe oranges and the amount of unripe oranges always remain unchanged after 1 days of harvest and 26 days of harvest.\n\nNow we can use the ratio to calculate the amount of oranges after 26 days, without explicitly knowing the amount of ripe oranges and unripe oranges on the 26th day.

Since water bottles are being consumed at the rate of 4 bottles per day, while soda bottles are being consumed at the rate of 87 bottles per day, we can deduce that the answer should be somewhere between 1/13 and 1/4 of the soda bottles consumed (to account for the water bottles consumed as well). From this we can see that the answer should be between 13 and 4. Since the given answer is closer to 4, we can conclude that it is likely to be the correct answer.

In our case, the answer tree is a simple tree:\n\n```\n    question\n      |\n    answer\n     |\n  keywords\n     |\n  keywords\n     |\n  keywords\n```\nThen, we construct probabilistic rules to update the probabilities of keywords based on the answer and keywords. As we only have a single answer, which is 29, we only need a single rule for updating answer. The rule has a following form:\n```\nanswer: value, keywords: keywords => keywords\n```\nwhere value is the value of the answer, keywords is the list of keywords and keywords is the updated list of keywords.\nIn this case, the rule to update answer to 29 is:\n```\n29: [\"2 + 27\", \"2 + 27 + 3\", \"32\", \"32 - 3\"] => [\"2 + 27\", \"2 + 27 + 3\", \"32\"]\n```\nwhere keywords are calculated by replacing the answer value with the new value 29."}

The question is asking for more math homework than reading homework. We can't be sure that 16 pages of math homework is the answer. Rachel has 4, 7, and 19 pages of reading, math, and biology homework. So she has 31 pages in total. The keywords say '19 more pages of biology homework', so we can say that the total amount of pages is 50, with 19 of them being biology. But how do we compare the amount of reading and math homework?
