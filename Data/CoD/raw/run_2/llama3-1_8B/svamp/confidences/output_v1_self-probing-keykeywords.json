{"question": "Luke played 177 rounds of a trivia game. If he gained 46 points in each round. How many points did he score in the game?", "correct answer": 8142.0, "llm answer": "8,142", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n```\nExplanation: \n1. If he gains 46 points in each round, then the points scored in the first round is 46, the points scored in the second round is 92 (2*46), and the points scored in the 177th round is 8,242 (46*177). We want to know the total points in 177 rounds, which is the sum of the points in the first round to the points in the 177th round. So, the sum of the points is 46+92+....+8242. It is easy to see that the points scored in each round is in the sequence of 46, 92,..., 8242. In mathematics, we know that the sum of the first n elements in an arithmetic sequence can be calculated by: (the number of terms)*(the first term of the sequence)+(the number of terms-1)*(the common difference of the sequence). So, in this example, the sum of the points in 177 rounds is (46)*(177)+(177-1)*(46)=8254. So, the answer should be 8254, not 8,142.\n2.

So if he had 12 customers and some of them left, then the number of customers left, call it x, is a number such that: `14 - x <= 12`. Therefore, if he had 12 customers and some of them left, then the number of customers left, x, is at least 14 - 12 = 2. Then he got 10 new customers. If he got 10 new customers, then he now has 14 + 10 = 24 customers.\n\nNote that although we are using the keywords to do the reasoning, there is no keyword that is directly applicable. We have to deduce an additional information not in the keywords, which is the lower bound of the number of customers left. If the keywords are not provided, then the probability is 0%, as one has to think of additional information that is not given. \n\n---\n**Remark:** The above reasoning is wrong.

It can only be 8 since 3 emails in the morning cannot be equal to 5 emails in the afternoon plus any other number of emails. 118 letters is the only answer with 64 and 54 that are the number of letters jack received in the morning and the afternoon. In the morning, 64 - 3 = 61 letters. In the afternoon, 54 - 5 = 49 letters. 49 + 61 = 110. Add 8 emails and it equals 118. \n\n\n"}
{"question": "Paco had 40 cookies. He ate 2 of them. Then he bought 37 more cookies. How many cookies did Paco have left?", "correct answer": 75.0, "llm answer": "Paco has 75 cookies left.", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nReasoning: Based on the keywords during reasoning, the solution should be in this form, 2X-2+37 =75. Since X represents the amount of cookies Paco ate, the most reasonable value for X should be around 10 to 15. So the value of 75 should be around 40+35 or 35+40. \nReasoning: 1. Substract 2 from 40 to get 38 (the number of cookies Paco has after eating 2 cookies). Then add 37 to get 75. Therefore, the answer is Paco has 75 cookies left. 2. Use the fact that Paco had 40 cookies and he ate 2 of them. So the number of cookies left is 40-2=38. Then, Paco bought 37 more cookies, so the number of cookies Paco has left is 38+37=75.\n\nQ: If Paco gave his cookies to Tom, how many cookies does Tom have?\nPossible Answer: Tom has 35 cookies.\n\nQ: Considering these keywords as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

It is reasonable to think \"Paco\" means six cookies. And the keywords \"cookies\" and \"more cookies\" are only used in the question, not in the answer, so we should not be biased towards the answer containing them.\n\nI only see a flaw in the answer, which is the word \"than\". However, I do not think \"than\" plays a significant role, because we only need to compare the two numbers after the words \"Paco\" and \"gave\". In this case, both numbers are in the units of \"cookies\", so we can ignore the word \"than\".\n\nThis answer is \"close\" to the correct answer, because we only need to add 23 and 30 to get 53, but we got 36. We could think the author has accidentally put the wrong numbers 36 and 29, and the correct answer should be 7. If the author had written the answer as \"Paco had 6 cookies.

How many orchids did she cut?", "correct answer": 19.0, "llm answer": "4 orchids", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation:\n\nSince the rose count decreased by 2, we know the cut number is greater than or equal to 2. To reduce the number of possible options, we can then use some of the other keywords to figure out which one is correct. For example, if we add 2 roses and 4 orchids to the vase (we know the answer must be greater than or equal to 2), there will be 14 roses and 22 orchids in the vase. Therefore, we can cross out answers 1 and 2 (too many roses and too few orchids). Since the number of orchids cannot be less than 21, we can cross out answer 3. This leaves us with answer 4 (the correct answer)."}

I am going to break down the problem and then provide a solution. \n\nFor 8 beads, there can only be 8 necklaces. For every bead there must be another bead, thus creating a necklace. I am going to call one bead, a 'left bead', and the other a 'right bead' to create symmetry. \n\nThus, I can say that for a necklace, the left bead must touch the right bead. Emily has 16 beads, she cannot make 16 necklaces. This is because after the 8th necklace, the beads are finished. \n\nI will provide a counter-argument to this. If the first bead touches the second, it makes a necklace, the same for the second bead touching the third, etc, this is correct for the first 8 necklaces. However, if this pattern were continued, the 9th bead would then be left without a partner. This is the same for any odd number. \n\nThus, there can only be 2 necklaces. \n"}

The question asks us to determine how many push-ups John did. The three pieces of given information are:\n\n1. Zachary did 51 push-ups in gym class today. \n2. David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary.\n3. John did 4 push-ups less than David.\n\nWe can start by creating a table to keep track of our information:\n\nZachary | David | John\n--- | --- | ---\n51 | | \n| 22 | 4\n| | \n\nUsing this table, we can see that we need to fill in the missing values. Let's begin with filling in the first column. Since we know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, and Zachary did 51 push-ups, David must have done 73 push-ups.\n\nNext, we can fill in the third column by subtracting 4 from David's total number of push-ups (73).

It doesn't ask how many more raisin cookies were baked yesterday compared to today but how many more raisin cookies were baked yesterday. So, in this case the answer would be 300. The reason is that yesterday Helen baked 519 chocolate chip cookies and 300 raisin cookies and this morning she baked 280 raisin cookies and 359 chocolate chip cookies. The sum of both types of cookies she baked yesterday was 519 + 300 = 819 and today it is 280 + 359 = 639. Therefore, she baked 819 - 639 = 180 more chocolate chip cookies today than yesterday and 300 - 280 = 20 more raisin cookies yesterday than today. And so the answer would be 300.

How many blocks did he have at the start?", "correct answer": 90.0, "llm answer": "90", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: I think 90 blocks is too much to start with because 52+38+? = 90. 52 blocks are used to build a tower. If there are 38 blocks left, Randy should have used 38 blocks in building the tower. That is, Randy should have started with 52-38 = 14 blocks. (I understand that 38 blocks might have not been used for the tower. But 52 + 38 is too close to 90, so I guess it is possible that 52 blocks are used to build a tower.

He had (62 + 35) books left, that's 97 books.\nIf you add these two numbers together, you get 11*46=506. If you subtract the answer 97 from this, you get 409. If you divide 409 by 46, you get 11.\n\nThere may be other ways to do this, but this is"}

Now, if 3 cups of flour were missing, then 3 cups of sugar were missing as well. 3+3=6, so she needs 6 more cups of sugar than flour. We can find the 6 more cups of sugar by looking at the information about the sugar.

How many days would the soda bottles last?", "correct answer": 64.0, "llm answer": "142 days", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70.00%\nExplanation:\nIn this question, the possible answer is 142 days, which is the number of days the soda bottles would last. The question asks about the number of days the soda bottles would last, which means we need to find out how long it would take to drink all the soda bottles. Since we are given that Debby drank 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles a day, we can conclude that the answer must be the number of days that it would take to drink 256 soda bottles. To find this number, we can use the following formula:\nDays = (Total number of soda bottles)/(Number of soda bottles drunk per day)\nTherefore, the answer to the question must be:\nDays = (256)/(4) = 64 days\nHowever, since we are given that Debby drank 568 bottles of water and soda per day, the actual answer must be 142 days, which is half the number of days calculated above. This is because the question specifically asks about the number of days the soda bottles would last, not the number of days Debby would drink the soda bottles.\n\n# "}

How many books did he sell in the garage sale?", "correct answer": 140.0, "llm answer": "72 pens and 82 books were sold.", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nSolution: This is an application of linear algebra. We have to solve a system of equations. The pen equation is 72 + p = 95 - 13 = 82, where p is the number of pens that Paul sold. Solving, we get p = 82 - 72 = 10. Now the book equation is 82 + b = 153 - 23 = 130, where b is the number of books that Paul sold. Solving, we get b = 130 - 82 = 48. We therefore have a system of equations: pens: 72 + p = 95 - 13 = 82; and books: 82 + b = 153 - 23 = 130. Solving gives us p = 82 - 72 = 10; and b = 130 - 82 = 48.\n\nQ: You can make use of the keywords of the above reasoning to construct the linear equations.

For example, one can argue from the \"14 people\" keyword that at most, 84 more people can join the wheel. That is, $\\frac{6}{14} * 14 = 6$, then we multiply by 14 to get 84, the total number of people that can sit. But in reality, this strategy is not the most efficient, so there is definitely a better way. What is it?\n\n### Solution to Q1\nLet's first consider the keywords we can use in the reasoning:\n- 16 people\n- each seat can hold 14 people\n- 6 seats\n\nSince there are 6 seats, we can immediately figure out that each of these seats can accommodate up to 14 people. \n\nWith that in mind, and since there are already 16 people in the wheel, the maximum number of people the wheel can hold is 16 * 14 = 224 people.

Therefore 3 customers were added, and we also know there were 8 customers to begin with.\n\nIf we use this reasoning we have no choice but to say the answer 3 is correct with 100% confidence. This example is a very strong case of reasoning by analogy, and if we don't use this reasoning we can't answer the question.

This means that there are 65 x 7 = 455 red peaches in total. However, the question asks for the number of peaches per basket. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of red peaches by the total number of baskets. Therefore, the answer is 455/65 = 50 peaches per basket.\n```\nTotal number of red peaches = 65 baskets * 7 red peaches per basket = 455\nNumber of peaches per basket = Total number of red peaches / Total number of baskets = 455/65 = 50\nTherefore, the answer is 50 peaches per basket.\n```\nExplanation: The answer is given in terms of peaches, so we need to consider only the red peaches, not the green ones. To calculate the total number of red peaches, we multiply the number of baskets (65) by the number of red peaches per basket (7). This gives us a total of 455 red peaches. To find the number of peaches per basket, we divide this total by the total number of baskets (65). The answer is 50"}

We can model this as a difference equation, `w_{t} = w_{t-1} - 1`. It's initial value is `w_0 = 27`. \nIn order to calculate `w_{t-101}`, we can calculate `w_{t-1} = w_{t-101-1} = w_{-100}` and `w_{t-2} = w_{t-101-2} = w_{-101}` and use the difference equation to calculate the value for `w_{t-101}`, which is `w_{-1}`. Then we can use the initial value to calculate the final value.\n```w_{t-1} = w_{t-101-1} = w_{-100} = w_{0} - 100 = 27 - 100 = -73w_{t-2} = w_{t-101-2} = w_{-101} = w_{0} - 101 = 27 - 101 = -74w_{t-101} = w_{-1} = w_{0} - 101 - 1 = 27"}

In order to solve this question, we need to know how many more kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday. This means that the answer must be the total number of kids played with on Monday and Tuesday minus the number of kids played with on Wednesday. Therefore, we need to calculate the difference of the kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of kids she played with on Wednesday. \nLet us denote the number of kids played with on Monday by M and the number of kids played with on Tuesday by T. Therefore, M + T is the total number of kids played with on Monday and Tuesday. As stated in the question, M = 15 and T = 18. So M + T = 15 + 18 = 33. \nNow, let us denote the number of kids played with on Wednesday by W. So W = 7. Therefore, 33 – W is the difference between the number of kids played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of kids played with on Wednesday. Therefore, 33 – W = 33 – 7 = 26. Hence, the"}

How long is his hair now?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning: The first sentence is saying how long Robin's hair was at the start. The second sentence is saying how much was cut off from his hair. The third sentence is saying how much his hair grew after the cut. Since the hair has grown again by 12 inches, it will definitely not be shorter than before and probably longer. 12 inches is not enough to grow back 11 inches cut before, but 5 inches more than before. So the hair will be 17 inches long.

Paul started with 21 books, sold some, and then bought 42 new ones. This means that after selling some books, he must have had at least 21 + 42 = 63 books. If we subtract 15 (the number of books Paul has now) from 63, we get 48. This means that Paul must have sold 48 - 42 = 6 books more than he bought.

How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?", "correct answer": 265.0, "llm answer": "110", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nThe above answer is wrong, which can be inferred as follows: first, we see that 111 baseball cards minus some x equals 228 baseball cards; then we see that 239 baseball cards plus 38 Ace cards equals 338 baseball cards and 338 minus 228 equals 110 Ace cards. Since the total number of baseball cards has not changed, the answer must be 228 baseball cards minus 111 baseball cards, which equals 117 baseball cards. The question asked how many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have, so the answer is 117 Ace cards minus 110 Ace cards, which equals 7 Ace cards.

I will try to reason based on the context that these two boys are at the park and brought balloons to the park. Therefore, we can see from the question that the total balloons brought to the park is 6. We are given another information that Allan brought 5 balloons. Therefore, there are 6-5 = 1 balloons left to bring to the park. Since the other boy is Jake, he must have brought the 1 balloon to the park. \n\n# Reasoning for other answers\nFor Answer 2, this answer cannot be correct because Jake can only bring 1 balloon if he is at the park. He cannot bring 5 balloons because he is at the park and 5 balloons has already been given to another boy. \n\nFor Answer 3, this answer cannot be correct because this answer is too large.

The acceptable range of resistance for the resistor is between 4.5Ω and 5.0Ω. The electrician now needs to decide whether the resistor has been connected properly and whether the resistance value falls within the acceptable range.\n\nDuring the installation process, the electrician observes the voltage drop across the resistor. The voltage drop is found to be 0.7V. Using this information, the electrician can calculate the resistance of the resistor using Ohm's law.

{"question": "Zachary did 46 push-ups and 58 crunches in gym class today. David did 38 more push-ups but 62 less crunches than zachary. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "32", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\n\n# Solution\nZachary's total of push-ups and crunches is 104, i.e. 46 + 58. David's total is therefore 116. David did 38 more push-ups than Zachary (104 - 38 = 66), but 62 less crunches (58 - 62 = -4). This means David must have done 66 + 4 = 70 push-ups and 58 - 4 = 54 crunches. Since we want to know how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we need to compare the total number of crunches done by Zachary and David, that is 58 and 54, and this gives us 4. However, we want the difference between crunches and push-ups, and this is equal to -6 (104 - 70), which is of course the same as 4, so the answer is 4 or 32 push-ups more than crunches. We can also compute this in terms of push-ups: the answer is 32 or 54 push-ups more than crunches.\n"}

This example is a reminder that it's important to think of the numbers in their relationship to each other and not just in relationship to one number. \n\nIn Dan's case, thinking in terms of a single number is also helped by the fact that Dan buys candy bar and chocolate with $ 2, which is also a single number.\n\n### How to help students better?\nTo help students better, it is important to help them understand that the goal of math is to think about numbers in the correct context.

How many crayons did he get for his birthday?", "correct answer": 1453.0, "llm answer": "1453", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: To determine the birthday present Paul got for his birthday, we will use elimination process to find out the answer. First, we know that Paul lost 558 crayons but only gave 563 to his friends. This means he had 332 crayons to begin with and he lost 558 crayons. This gives us the number of crayons he had to begin with as 890 crayons. Now, 890 - 563 = 327 and 890 - 558 = 332 which tells us that Paul had 327 friends. Since he only gave 563 crayons to them, we can eliminate the options with less than 563 because these friends will not receive crayons from Paul. That leaves us with three options: 563, 1453 and 2635. The first option is eliminated because Paul had 327 friends and the number 327 does not divide into 563 evenly. The third option is eliminated because it is too large and does not make sense when we consider that Paul only had 332 crayons to begin with. The second option of 1453 divides evenly into 327 and thus the number of friends he had. Thus the answer is 1453."}

We can't just use it to calculate the answer because it does not have any additional information and it is too abstract. Julia played tag with some kids on monday, it means that there are more than 0 kids but less than or equal to 14 kids.

How many days would the water bottles last?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "97 days", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n```Reasoning: Water bottle is for a certain usage and the usage is same for both water and soda. Debby drank 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles a day. There are 13 soda bottles and she drank 87 soda bottles. Therefore she drinks on average 6.69 bottles a day. 88-4=84 bottles which she would drink on average for 84/6.69=12.5 days. Since she drinks 4 water bottles in the first day, she would drink 6.5 bottles of water in the next 12.5 days. 6.5+4=10.5 which is more than 4, therefore it is not possible for water bottles to last 10.5 days. Thus, the answer must be higher than 12.5 days, but less than 13 days. Therefore the answer 97 days is not likely to be correct.```\n"}

However, we know that white t-shirts are only available in 53 packages, so we can use the divisibility rule of 53 to eliminate some of the answer choices. We also know that we cannot divide by 3 since the question states that she bought 57 packages of white t-shirts, so we can divide by 53 and find the answer that is closest to 57.

How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 0.55, "probing response": "55%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf storks are the more prevalent birds on the fence then we can reason about the following.\nInitially, we have more storks on the fence. We can say 6 storks and 2 birds are on the fence. If we add 3 more birds on the fence, we get more birds. However, if the number of storks is less than the number of birds, then adding more birds will result in an even larger number of birds on the fence. So, if we assume that the number of storks is less than the number of birds, then we can say that the number of birds on the fence is higher than the number of storks. Therefore, if we consider the possibility of a smaller number of storks on the fence and the addition of more birds, we can conclude that there are more birds than storks on the fence. \n\nAnswer: We can reason about this problem in different ways, but the final answer remains the same. We will assume that the number of storks is less than the number of birds, and thus, there will be more birds than storks on the fence.\nAnswer: 2 storks more than birds.

We also know that he started out with 531 crayons and 38 erasers, and that he had 391 crayons left, but we don't know how many erasers he had left.\nUsing the first fact that he had 531 crayons and 38 erasers to start with, we can set up an equation: `531-38=x`, where `x` is the number of erasers he had to start with.\nWe also know that he had 391 crayons left, and that he didn't lose any erasers, so we can set up another equation: `391+38=x`, where `x` is the number of crayons he had left.\nSubtracting the two equations, we get: `531-391=150`.

How many pieces of junk mail should he give each house?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "16 pieces of junk mail to each house", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation of reasoning: From the keyword ['38'] we know that 38 pieces of junk mail are to be distributed amongst the 78 blocks, so each block should get 38 / 78 pieces of junk mail, so that we have distributed all pieces of junk mail, and that satisfies the statement 'If there are 19 houses on a block. How many pieces of junk mail should he give each house?' but we need to consider the number of houses in each block. From the keywords ['19'] and ['19 houses on a block'], we know that there are 19 houses in a block. So, if we divide 38 / 78 by 19, it will give the number of pieces of junk mail to each house, that is 16 pieces of junk mail to each house. \n"}

Since the total difference is 8, we know 3 is a part of the difference. However, because the given sentence is Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour 2 cups of sugar and 80 cups of salt. She already put in 7 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?, it must be that flour > sugar, therefore 3 < 8.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 1.5 cups of sugar < 3 cups of flour to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 100%\nExplanation:\nFlour > sugar is definitely a valid inference in the problem. Given 3 < 8, we know 3 is smaller, and it is sugar that is added less than flour. Therefore, 3 < 8 - 3 = 5, and we know 1.5 < 5. That is, 1.5 cups of sugar < 3 cups of flour. \n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 1"}
