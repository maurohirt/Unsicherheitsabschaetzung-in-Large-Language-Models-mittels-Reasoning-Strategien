First, I think the keywords should be interpreted as 18 bananas in each group.\n2. Since there are 180 bananas in total, we know that there are 10 groups, because 18 x 10 = 180. \n3. Since Philip organized his bananas into groups of 18, I think the answer should be 10 because 18 x 10 = 180. \n\nHowever, we have not seen the keywords being used this way before, which means it's a different approach to use them. Although I can understand what the author was thinking about, it's not the best way to use the keywords, because the keywords should be interpreted as 18 bananas in each group. And the answer can also be 10, as it's a more straightforward way to solve this problem.\n\nOverall, I think this is an average approach to solve this problem, because the reasoning is clear, but it's not the best way to use the keywords.

How many pencils does she have?", "correct answer": 84.0, "llm answer": "23", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n```Confidence: 90%```\nI just reasoned that I already know that there are 6 packs of pencils each with 14 pencils.

She now has 3 full rows of pencils and 12 pencils left over. 3 + 12 = 15 pencils, but 15 pencils is not one of the answer choices. I have never seen someone have 0 pencils and still be able to put their pencils into rows, so I assume that this is a typo. Since the answer choices include a zero, I am guessing that 23 pencils is the answer choice that was intended. It is possible that I misunderstood the question, and that the number of rows was meant to be 14 rather than 22. In that case, the answer is 3. I will have to think about it more. 90%"}

The difference between the number of students who prefer bacon and mashed potatoes is 10. The total number of students is 489 + 479 = 968. The probability that a student randomly selects bacon or mashed potatoes is 489/968 and 479/968. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected student prefers bacon over mashed potatoes is 489 - 479 = 10/968 = 0.1. Hence, the probability of 10 students suggesting more bacon than mashed potatoes is 0.1 and its likelihood is 0.1/0.1 = 100%."}

{"question": "A mailman has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block. If there are 20 houses on a block. How many pieces of junk mail should he give in each block?", "correct answer": 180.0, "llm answer": "180", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\nReasoning:\nThe first thing I saw from the key words were 20 and 9, and I was thinking 20 is the number of houses and 9 is the number of mail pieces for each house. I think the mailman will give 20*9 = 180 pieces of junk mail in one block.\nI also thought the answer to be 180, but then I saw that the answer has a block as its unit, so I think there will be 9*20 = 180 blocks and then there will be 180*9 = 1620 pieces of junk mail in 180 blocks.\nI am not sure if my reasoning is correct or not, but I think the answer is more likely to be 1620, because it is a larger number."}

Since apples are not included in the bottles (because bottles have both regular and diet soda), we only need to consider the number of bottles. To do this, we can subtract the number of apples from the total number of bottles. So, 80 + 54 - 36 = 98, which is the number of bottles minus the number of apples. This means that there are 98 bottles more than apples. Therefore, the answer is 134, since 98 + 36 = 134. Thus, the answer is \"Possible Answer: 134\".\n```Additional Information: ['36', '80', '54', '36 + 80 + 54 = 170', '134']```\nIn this case, there is no need to use this information, since the information we already have is enough to get the correct answer.\n```Conclusion: [confidence of 134 is correct]```\nIn this case, the confidence of the answer \"Possible Answer: 134\" is 75%.\n```Answer: 134, with confidence of"}

The question asks how many days would the soda bottles last. So we need to calculate how many days soda bottles last? We know Debby drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day. To calculate days, we need to calculate the number of soda bottles left by adding up the soda bottles drank a day (9) and subtract it from the total soda bottles Debby bought (360) which gives us 351 (360-9). We need to know how many bottles Debby bought because if we divide 351 soda bottles by 9 soda bottles she drank a day we get 39 which is the answer we need, which is the number of days. However, the question also states she drank 122 water bottles. The only reason we add up the number of water bottles is to get an answer we think is correct and can relate it to the answer above. But as we know Debby drank 9 soda bottles which is the only relevant number to the question.

We also know that during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game they sold 186 t-shirts. To determine how much money they made from the Texas Tech game, we need to know how many t-shirts they sold during the Texas Tech game, so we subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold during both games: 186 – 172 = 14. Thus, we can conclude that they made a profit of $ 78 per t-shirt sold, which means that they made $ 78 x 14 = $ 1,092 in profits from the Texas Tech game.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer $ 14,508 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 0%"}

How many minutes did the machine work yesterday?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "17 minutes (rounded up)", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\n# Answer:\nFirst, we can calculate how many minutes the machine worked today. We know that the machine can make 3 shirts a minute. If it made 44 shirts today, we can say that it worked for 44/3 minutes. This equals 14 minutes and 4/3. We can round up to 15 minutes. Since the machine worked 15 minutes today, we know it worked 15-9 minutes yesterday. The difference is 6 minutes. To find how many shirts the machine made yesterday, we know it made 6 shirts for 6 minutes. Therefore, it made 6 x 3 or 18 shirts per minute. 18 shirts is 18/3, or 6 shirts per minute. The machine worked for 6 x 6 or 36 minutes yesterday, so it made 36 x 6 or 216 shirts. The answer is 216."}

The ratio is therefore 21:12. Since 21:12 = 7:4, then you need 4 times more sugar than flour. In this question, there are 9 cups of flour, so you need 4 x 9 = 36 cups of sugar. However, there are only 10 cups of sugar so far. 36 - 10 = 26 cups of sugar that are still needed.

If we subtract 17 from 8, we get -9. If we then add 13 to -9, we get 4. We know that we need to add because 13 is more than 8. We also know that we need to subtract 17 because it is fewer than 8.

We know Debby has 157 bottles of water left, and there are a total of 301 bottles she purchased, so she has consumed 144 bottles. 301 - 157 = 144, which is exactly the amount she has consumed. Therefore, Debby has consumed 144 bottles. We know that Debby has consumed 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left, we can subtract 144 from 157 to get 13. Therefore, she has drunk 13 bottles a day for 144 days. So the answer should be 144. \n\nConfidence: 60%\n"}

If the keyword is related to the target information (either the left side or the right side of the information), and it is the only one piece of evidence of this type, then the answer is 50%, because the reasoning is not valid. If there is more than one piece of evidence, we need to judge the strength of each piece of evidence. A piece of evidence is strong when 1. it is strong and unique, 2. it is strong and common, or 3. it is strong and common with the evidence from step 1. For the current problem, the keyword is \"cakes\", and the target information is \"sold\". Keyword \"cakes\" is both a left-side keyword and a right-side keyword, so this is not a unique evidence. \"Sold\" and \"bought\" are not very related, so this is not a strong evidence. So we can say the evidence is weak, but there are more than one evidence, so the answer should be between 40% and 50%. \n```Confidence: 50%"}

The task is to determine how many more pages the second chapter has than the first chapter.\n\nLet's analyze the possible answer of \"43 more pages\" and try to reason using the given keywords. Since the second chapter is 80 pages long and the first chapter is 37 pages long, we can subtract the two numbers to get the difference. Thus, we have 80 - 37 = 43, which means that the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.\n\nWhen considering the given keywords, it becomes clear that the second chapter indeed has 43 more pages than the first chapter. The keywords '37 pages' and '80 pages' provide us with the actual page lengths of both chapters, while the keyword '43 more pages' specifies the exact difference between them.\n\nTherefore, given the provided keywords and our reasoning, we can conclude that the possible answer of \"43 more pages\" is likely to be correct with a confidence level of 95.8%."}

{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.006500000000000001, "probing response": "0.65%\n\nSolution: Reasoning:\nAs Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers, they are two different sets and are collected separately. So, the 29 bottle caps and the 82 wrappers can be added to get the total number of objects Danny found at the park, i.e. 29 + 82 = 111. Now, considering the 42 bottle caps and the 61 wrappers that Danny has in his collection, we can count the total number of objects in his collection, i.e. 42 + 61 = 103. Subtracting 103 from 111, we get the number of objects Danny has left from the park. Since he only collects bottle caps, Danny must have had 2 bottle caps left behind.\nThe 82 wrappers at the park is a bit of a red herring, which is used to give Danny a reason to go to the park. But, since Danny doesn't collect wrappers, he doesn't have any wrappers in his collection. As a result, the 61 wrappers in his collection are not relevant.\n\n---\n\n```Confidence: 0.65%```\n```Confidence: 0.75%```\n```Confidence: 0.45%```\n```Confidence: 0."}

{"question": "In a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys. 418 more girls joined the school. How many pupils are there in the school now?", "correct answer": 1346.0, "llm answer": "1346", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\nThe question tells that the number of girls is 706 and 222 boys, then 418 more girls are added. It is important that the question does not tell which number is greater, the total number of girls or the total number of boys. Hence we need to know which numbers are the sum. Now we can try to do some subtraction to find out what the current total number of girls is, because if the total number of girls is greater than the total number of boys, we need to find the total number of girls. Let's use 706 as the sum of girls. If the total number of boys is 222, then we can find the total number of boys as 706-222=484. If we use 418 as the sum of girls, then we can find the current total number of girls as 706+418-484=640. So we can find the total number of girls as 706, and we can find the current total number of boys as 222. We can now find the total number of pupils as 706+222=928. If we use 418 as the sum of girls, then we can find the current total number of pupils as 706+418+222=1446.\n\nI"}

On the right hand side of the equation, however, we need to first compute the value of 14 + 63, which is a cumbersome procedure because we need to add numbers together in a column and we do not know which number is bigger and which is smaller. \n* We can eliminate answer choice 1 and 2, because the addition would be larger than 10.\n* For 3, 4 and 5, we can do addition without knowing which number is larger. We can deduce the values on the right hand side of the equation by taking away the value on the left hand side of the equation from the value on the right hand side of the equation. If the value is positive, there are more children that got on the bus than got off the bus and if the value is negative, it is the opposite. \n* For 3, we get 4 + (63 - 5) = 62, which is greater"}

How many snakes were not hiding?", "correct answer": 31.0, "llm answer": "31", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nSolution by:\nZiyu Liu\n\nExplanation:\nWe have to know the number of snakes that are not hiding to get the right answer. In order to figure out the number of snakes that are not hiding, we need to first figure out how many snakes are hiding. By using our keywords, we can solve this question. The keywords for this question are as follows:\n\n`[95 + 61', '95 - 64']`\n\nIf we add the total number of snakes (95) to the total number of alligators (61), we get a number (156) that is bigger than the total number of snakes in the zoo (95 + 61 = 156). This means that the number of snakes that are not hiding must be smaller than this number. So, the number of snakes that are not hiding must be smaller than 156. If we subtract the number of snakes that are hiding (64) from the total number of snakes (95), we get a number (31) that is bigger than the number of snakes that are not hiding (95 - 64 = 31). This means that the number of snakes that are not hiding must be bigger than this number. So, the number of snakes that are not hiding must be"}

{"question": "He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 16 sacks per day and that each sack containes 57 oranges. How many days will it take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "0.88 (rounded to 1)", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation: To solve this question, we need to use our understanding of the problem and the given information to make a reasonable assumption about the number of days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. Since we know that each sack contains 57 oranges and that 16 sacks are harvested per day, we can calculate how many days it would take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. If we divide 912 (80 sacks multiplied by 57 oranges per sack) by the number of oranges harvested per day, we can get the number of days it would take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. Using a calculator or a calculator app, we can calculate that it would take 16 days (912 oranges divided by 57 oranges per day) to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. Since we are rounding to the nearest whole number, we would round 16.0 days up to 17 days.\n\nThe possible answer, 0.88, is rounded to 1 (or 17). This would be correct if the person in the story was referring to the number of oranges harvested in one day instead of the number of days it would take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.

How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges?", "correct answer": 600.0, "llm answer": "7200", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: \n\n```The key keywords in this question are \"discard\", \"per day\" and \"sack\". We are given that 76 sacks are harvested per day. We are also given that 64 of these sacks are discarded. We can infer that 12 sacks are not discarded. Each sack contains 50 oranges. So we have 12 sacks that contain 50 oranges each, that means we have 12 x 50 = 600 oranges that are not discarded per day. The total oranges harvested per day must be greater than this number. Therefore the correct answer must be greater than 600. The only option given that satisfies this condition is 7200.

The question asks us to calculate the number of apples the tree had to begin with, which is the whole amount. Therefore, we need to find the total number of apples by adding the number of picked apples and remaining apples. The picked apples are 2, and the remaining apples are 7.

The additional information given in the question can only imply that he initially had more action figures on the shelf, but not how many he initially had. Given the 10 action figures on the shelf after Jerry added 2 more action figures and removed 7 of the old ones, we do not know what Jerry has done to the action figures that are still on the shelf.

In the case that Jerry removed 7 of the less similar action figures to the 10 action figures on the shelf, the initially had more than 5 action figures.

The second statement gives me information that the number of blocks must be divisible by 4. The statement in the question is asking for the number of houses in a block. Therefore, the number of houses must be divisible by both 8 and 4. The LCM of 8 and 4 is 8 * 4 = 32. So the number of houses should be 32 * some number. The first statement tells us that number of pieces of mail given to a block should be divisible by the number of houses in a block. This gives me the condition that this number should be divisible by 32. We know that we will distribute 8 pieces of mail in each house in a block, so the number of pieces of mail to be distributed in a block must be divisible by 8. The first statement gives us that number as 32.

Also, we know that the tree now has 2 ripe apples. To make the total 6, we need to add 4 unripe apples to the 2 ripe apples. Since 2 + 4 = 6, the original number of apples must have been 6 + 6 = 12.\n```Confidence: 50%```\nExplanation:\nThe keyword '6 ripe apples' and '2 + 4 = 6' give us the original number of apples. The keyword '2 ripe apples' and '4 unripe apples' give us the number of apples on the tree now. We can check if these two sets of keywords are consistent with each other. '6 ripe apples' and '2 ripe apples' imply that the number of ripe apples on the tree now is the same as the number of ripe apples that Rachel picked.

It could be possible that Ed has more marbles than Doug and vice versa. However, since there is a +9 and -27, it could be possible that we can just ignore the numbers before that and focus on the numbers after that. So we have Ed found 9 marbles and Doug lost 27 marbles. In this case, it is possible that Ed has the same number of marbles as Doug, therefore, we can't say that Ed has more marbles than Doug. \n\nQ: Can you answer the question now?\n\nConfidence: 100%\nExplanation: I have thought that Ed has more marbles than Doug, so I think 33 is correct.

I am pretty sure that Adam and Jackie don't have 6 apples altogether, but just 1 each. Therefore it is likely that he refers to Adam with 4 and Jackie with 1. If this reasoning is correct, then he must have 6 apples altogether as the narrator mentions.\nThis reasoning can be supported by additional reasoning and information:\n```\n1) 4+1 = 5 (Adam + Jackie), if Adam has 5 and Jackie 1, then the narrator might mean to say that Adam and Jackie have 5 apples and he has 1 more than them altogether, i.e. 6 apples.

Therefore, a good answer should describe the steps of the reasoning process, starting from text and transforming into numbers to conduct the computation.

Lastly, this question is about explaining the reasoning process. The description of reasoning should include the process from words to numbers, including how to transform words into numbers to conduct computation.\nThe given keywords provide enough information to answer the question: \"2 died\" and \"9 survived\".

So we know that there are 7-15= -8 cakes that he sold. He did not lose any cakes, so -8= 0 and therefore 7= 15.\n\nThe information shows there are 103 pastries left. So we know that there are 148-103= 45 pastries that he sold. He did not lose any pastries, so 45= 45 and therefore 148= 103.\n\nWith the above information, we can infer that the remaining pastries must equal the number of remaining cakes which is 15.\n\nIn a similar question, you were able to solve for a baker having 7 cakes. However, this does not mean you can conclude that he also has 7 pastries. You can conclude this if and only if you know that pastries and cakes are both the same unit (such as, both are cups of flour, or both are slices of cakes, etc.).

How many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.905, "probing response": "90.5%\n```Reasoning:\n1. Since there are 11 books and 17 movies, the number of movies is more than books, thus it's less than or equal to 11.\n2. Since you read 13 books and watched 63 movies, 63 - 13 = 50. Hence, there must be at least 50 more movies than books.\n3. From 1. and 2., 50 <= (17 - 11) => 11 <= (17 - 50) => -39 <= (17 - 50)\n4. From 3. and the given that 13 books are read and 63 movies are watched, 13 movies must have been watched for -39 movies to be read.\n5. 13 movies are read from a total of 17 movies => 4 movies are left for 50 movies.\n6. Therefore, 50 movies and 11 books are there in total in the 'crazy silly school' series, and the difference between movies and books is 50 - 11 = 39 movies, which is 4 more than 11 books.```\n\nQ: The following question is the same as the question above, but some keywords are missing.

How many books did he read?", "correct answer": 41.0, "llm answer": "289 books", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: Since it took Frank 12 days to finish a book of 66 pages, he reads 66 / 12 = 5.5 pages per day.\nIt took Frank 492 days to finish all books. That's 492 * 5.5 = 2,712 pages. So he read 2,712 / 66 = 41 books.\nBut Frank started a new book each day, so he must have read half a book at the end of the last day. So he read 41.5 books.\n\nThe first half of the question gave us the keywords that were used in the reasoning, but there were no keywords about 41 books, 41.5 books or Frank. \n\nA quick way to find keywords is to highlight text on the page you are reading.\n\nAnother useful strategy is to use your knowledge and reason. If we look at the possible answers, we can reason that 289 is a fairly large number for someone who read 66 pages in 12 days. This might indicate that the answer is larger than 41 books and the answer is likely to be in the range of 100 books or more.\n\nUsing the keywords in the reasoning can help you to understand the problem, and you might be able"}
{"question": "David did 36 more push-ups but 33 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "94", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\n\n## My solution\n\nThe most important thing to remember is not to do anything when you see a number. Instead, ask yourself what do I need to do with this number to find the correct answer? In this case, the answer should be the difference between the number of push ups and the number of crunches. That is, if you need to do 36 more push ups, then you need to do (58-36) fewer push ups. Now the question becomes how many less push ups is 36? To answer this question, you need to figure out how many more push ups do 36 push ups represent? That is, if Zachary did 58 push ups and you did 36 push ups, then how many push ups did Zachary do? Well, 58 is the answer. Hence, the number of push ups you did represents (58-36) fewer push ups.\n\nIf the above reasoning sounds a little bit complicated, then you can always rely on the following simple approach: first you need to calculate the number of push ups that you did; then you need to calculate the number of push ups that you did not do. Once you have the number of push ups that you did not do, then you can use the"}

The horse had only to be asked a question; he knew the answer in advance, and he would just stop whenever he arrived at the answer.\n\nMany people believed this horse was a genuine marvel, but this horse had a human cooperator: its owner, a Mr. von Osten, who would tell the horse how many steps he needed to take to get to the answer. Von Osten would just whisper in the horse’s ear and the horse would just do as he was told. Unfortunately for von Osten, a mathematician, Oskar Pfungst, discovered that the horse was not actually answering questions.

They planted 36 seeds and 36 seeds grew into flowers. There is a discrepancy of 0 seeds. As we know, they planted 36 seeds and 36 seeds grew into flowers. Hence, the number of seeds that didn't grow into flowers is 0 seeds. Hence, the percentage of seeds that didn't grow into flowers is 0/36 = 0 = 0%.
