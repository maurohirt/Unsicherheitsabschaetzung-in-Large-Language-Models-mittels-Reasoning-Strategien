If she collected 49 more dollars, then there would be 52 dollars in her wallet. After Olivia visited a supermarket, there were 49 dollars left. Thus she spent $3 dollars at the supermarket. If we subtract 49 dollars from 52 dollars, we get $3 dollars, which is the amount Olivia spent at the supermarket. Therefore, the correct answer is 3. This answer is 95% likely to be correct.\nConfidence: 75%\n\nReasoning: The question is asking how many more dollars Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket. From the statement \"There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet\", we know that there were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet before she went to the ATM. Then from \"She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM\", we know that Olivia collected 49 more dollars from the ATM. Therefore, she had a total of 52 dollars in her wallet after she went to the ATM.

In fact, they provide all necessary information to the problem. For example, we know the amount of the crayons, the amount of the erasers, the difference between the initial amount and the final amount of the crayons, and the final amount of the crayons, so the information of the final amount of the erasers can be derived by a simple subtraction between the initial amount of the erasers and the final amount of the crayons. Second, although the reasoning is clear, it may not be correct. For example, the lost crayons are counted by comparing the initial amount and the final amount of crayons instead of the initial amount of crayons and the difference between the initial amount and the final amount of crayons.

The above question should also follow the same strategy, since there are only 10 questions in total. Since 40% is smaller than the threshold (95%), I can guess randomly and the result of correct answers will be 2.5 (25%), which is higher than 2 (20%).

Why?\nA better approach is to compare the mouse to the frog instead of the grasshopper. Since the problem says the mouse jumped 16 less than the frog, it's easy to just subtract 16 from the frog's jump to get 23. From there, 23 less than the grasshopper's jump of 14 equals 9. The frog jumped 9 inches farther than the grasshopper, and since the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog,"}

The reasoning above is incomplete. I only included two steps for Orchids, while you included four. I didn't include the reasoning for the total, because the total is simply the sum of the two steps for roses and orchids.\n2. I think it's safe to assume there were originally more orchids than roses. Therefore, it's possible that Jessica cut some orchids but not roses, and if so, it's more likely that she cut the same number of orchids as roses.\n3. I also think it's safe to assume that she cut some flowers, not all of them. So, if the original number of flowers was 14, and she cut 3, then the new number of flowers would be 11, which is not what the question states.\n4.

Also, if I have 230 $ 1 notes and I put them into 23 rows, there are at least 10 rows.\n\nExplanation:\nTo solve for the number of t-shirts sold we have to divide the amount of money sold by the money per shirt. The result is 10 shirts. The answer of 10 shirts has a 60% chance of being correct because of these reasons.

Since there are only two students, Katie's fraction of total games is 81 / 100 and her friend's fraction of total games is 59 / 100. Katie's games plus her friend's games equals 140. This indicates that the other students have the total games of 140. Then the sum of Katie's games and her friend's games divided by 140 equals 1. 140 / 140 is 1, so there should be no extra games besides the 100 games. Hence, Katie's games should be 22 more than her friend's games.\n\nQ: Do you think the above reasoning is correct?

How many push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 35.0, "llm answer": "35", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: We are asked to use the information provided above to reason about whether answer 35 is correct. Given there are two possible ways to calculate Zachary's push-ups, the first is by substracting 9 from 44. While the second is to calculate Zachary's push-ups by David's 44 and then subtract 9, which is equivalent to David's push-ups 44 minus the push-ups he is ahead. I prefer the first one, however, the logic is the same. There are three possible situations. The first is the answer is correct. In that case, we can consider this as a given. Given this information, it is likely to be true that answer 35 is correct, because it is possible that answer 44 is correct, but the situation where answer 44 is not correct is not. In that case, answer 44 and 35 both might be incorrect. Then the probability of answer 35 being correct is 1/2. The second is that the answer 35 is incorrect. In that case, we do not know if answer 44 is correct, since this is not given in the question. But the answer 44 is not correct is possible, which means answer 35 can not be"}

In this problem, Edward has only 19 dollars now. Therefore, he could not have 23 dollars before he spent his money. Also, it says that he bought books and pens and he has 19 dollars now.

Then we just need to solve step 1, step 2 and step 3. To start with step 3, we need to convert all the cups into the same unit, so we should convert salt into cups, which leads to 7*1.5 = 10.5 cups of salt. Then we can finish step 1 and 2, which makes 10 - 10.5. Then we can make a reasonable conclusion, that the 3 cups of flour is probably too much, but the 10 cups of sugar might be not enough, thus the possible answer should be 3 or 10.```\n"}

In step 3, we know that the roses in the vase decreased from 15 to 17. The difference in the number of roses before and after Jessica throwing away some roses in the vase must be positive. So the difference in step 3, 17 - 15 = 2, must also be positive. \nStep 5 is the part that made me realize step 4 is probably not correct, because if the number of roses before Jessica is 15, how can she throw away 33 roses. If we use step 4, roses cut = 2 + 33 = 35. This number is reasonable because it's probably more likely to cut more roses to add to the vase than to throw away roses from the vase. So I think the possible answer is correct.\n```"}

This is why there is no need to list each pot. We can simply use a number to represent each pot.\nStep 2: Each pot has 53 flowers. For any pot, there are 53 flowers in total. Since this is true for each pot, it means that for 466 pots, there are 53 x 466 = 24638 flowers in total.\nStep 3: Each pot has 181 sticks. For any pot, there are 181 sticks in total. Since this is true for each pot, it means that for 466 pots, there are 181 x 466 = 84626 sticks in total.\nStep 4: We have already found the number of flowers to be 24638 and the number of sticks to be 84626. Therefore, the total number of flowers and sticks is 24638 + 84626 = 109264.\nStep 5: The reasoning given is clear and there is no alternative interpretation of the given reasoning.

If you are able to identify the process and any errors that may have occurred, then you can estimate the probability of the answer being correct.\n\nIt appears that the answer was generated by solving a math problem using the given information. The problem can be stated as follows: If Paul started with 110 crayons and lost 42 of them and gave away 90 crayons, how many more crayons did he lose than he gave away?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can subtract the number of crayons lost from the number of crayons given away. If we do this, we get:\n\nNumber of crayons lost - Number of crayons given away = 42 - 90 = -48\n\nThis suggests that the answer to the problem is -48, which corresponds to the answer \"322\" in the question.\n\nBased on this process, it appears that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the confidence in the correctness of the answer is 100%."}

Let $x$ denote the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested in a day. We know that after 6 days, they harvested $65 \\times 6 = 390$ sacks of oranges. There are 65 unripe and 46 ripe sacks of oranges each day, so there must be $\\frac{390}{65+46} = 2$ sacks of unripe oranges harvested each day.

If you allow this answer to be the correct one, the question also implies that the palace was visited on all the days before the 245th day and that it was not visited on all the days after the 245th day. If you think the question is about \"what is the largest\" then you can just say 1371 is the answer.\n\nThis discussion board is a place to discuss our Daily Challenges and the math and science related to those challenges.

{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "correct answer": 44.0, "llm answer": "3.406", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: The final answer is obtained by multiplying the first answer by the third. As all of the answers are equal in format and have same length, they are very likely to be obtained by performing the same set of operations. However, a more accurate approach may be to consider the distribution of the possible answers, and make an estimate based on the distribution. In this case, we know that 193 has many prime factors, thus making it difficult to multiply by 15 directly. 660 has many factors but only a few prime factors, which makes the computation easier than 193. Hence, the most likely result is to use the same operation as in the possible answer, that is multiplying the two numbers together. However, the most accurate method is to calculate the sum of the squares of the two numbers, which gives an estimated value of 193 × 660. The square of this number is then taken, giving a value of 2.4×10^12, which is the most likely answer. The final answer is thus 3.406."}

For each column, we have a numerical value corresponding to our confidence. Let's call this function to be a function `Confidence`. For each question, we first try to find the majority vote, for example, by finding the answer with the most number of votes (or simply, the highest row sum of that column). If the majority vote is higher than `Confidence` of the other answers, we know that is the right answer with high confidence. If not, we can look into the details of the other answers and decide how to break the tie. One possibility is to calculate the ratio of number of votes of that answer over the total votes of that column, and then check how high this ratio is.

We can determine the number of trees that survived using the given information. \nThe number of trees that survived is calculated by subtracting the number of trees that died from the total number of trees. In this case, the total number of trees is 11 and the number of trees that died is 2. Subtracting 2 from 11 gives us the number of trees that survived, which is 9. Therefore, the answer is 9 trees survived the typhoon.```"}

One of the more intuitive ways is to imagine this scenario on the number line: The number line goes from -infinity to +infinity. On that number line we place the numbers 0 to 157 in ascending order. Then we take a pencil and draw a 146 long segment from the right side of number 0 to the left side of number 157. Now we start counting on this segment the points Luke got, from right to left. Since this segment is 146 points long, Luke got 146 points per round. Since the number of rounds is 157, then the total points is 146 x 157 = 22982 points.\n\nQ: In the game of basketball, what would be"}
