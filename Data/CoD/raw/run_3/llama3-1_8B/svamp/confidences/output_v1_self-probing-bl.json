{"question": "Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack. How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?", "correct answer": 51.0, "llm answer": "114", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nPossible Answer: 114\n\nQ: If I am wrong, please explain why and point out where the error is. Your explanation should be short and precise, i.e., less than 20 words.\n\nAnswer: 0\n\n\nI think the answer to be 114 is correct. First of all, 76 is the original price of the pack, and we get the discount of 25 dollar, which means we are going to pay 76-25=51 dollars. Thus, the 51 dollars is the price after the discount, so the final price should be 51*2=102. Therefore, the final answer should be 102.\n"}

Now, we need to find the number of girls in the school now. We know that there are 2183 students and 732 girls. Then, the number of girls in the school now is 2183 - 732 = 1451.

I think the best way to solve this problem is to start with what we know. There were 93 snakes and 97 alligators. But, 40 of the alligators were hiding. So, that means that there were 97 - 40 alligators that were not hiding. That is 57. Now, to answer the confidence part, we need to think about how sure we are that this answer is correct. We are 100% sure because we know that 57 is the only number that fits into the problem. So, the confidence is 100%.

The number of shirts the machine made yesterday is fixed because it was yesterday and the machine has been working for a while, so there is no more improvement. Thus, the total number of shirts that can be made by the machine is fixed.\nThe machine made 8 shirts today. The number of shirts the machine made today is random because it can still be more or less shirt depending on how much the machine is working. It can be more because it might not have been working at a full speed yet (because it just started working today) or it might have been working very hard. It can be less because the machine might have not worked for very long. Thus, the total number of shirts that can be made by the machine is not fixed.\nSince the number of shirts that can be made by the machine yesterday and today are different, the total number of shirts that can be made by the machine is not fixed. \nSince the total number of shirts that can be made by the machine is not fixed, the machine must be working for an unknown amount of time.

Let X be the number of students that suggests bacon. The probability of getting k bacon is P(X=k)={310 \\choose k}0.6^k0.4^{310-k},k=0,...,310. The question asks for k, so we just need to look for the k where P(X=k) is the highest. For small n, we can calculate the probabilities for each k and look for the highest probability, but in this case the highest probability does not appear among those we can calculate (we can calculate probabilities for all k from k=0 to 310). However, we can look at the expected value and see that it is around 1.85 times p which is equal to 1.85 times 0.6 which is equal to 1.11 times 185 which is 210.

We are a team of data analysts trying to make a positive impact in this world. You can learn more about us and our mission on our website.\n\nSolution: This problem is a classic example of conditional probability. The key idea here is to find the probability of reading a book given that you read $x$ books and watched $y$ movies. We will use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.\n\nLet's start by defining some random variables:\n\n$X =$ Number of books read\n$Y =$ Number of movies watched\n\nThen, the desired probability is $P(X=x|Y=y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are given values.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can write this as follows:\n\n$P(X=x|Y=y) = \\frac{P(Y=y|X=x) \\cdot P(X=x)}{P(Y=y)}$\n\nNow, we need to calculate each term in this equation. For $P(Y=y|X=x)$, we can use the multiplication rule:\n\n$P(Y=y|X=x) = P(Y=y \\cap X=x) = P(Y=y) \\cdot P(X=x)$\n\nWe"}

{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. If the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height and he stands at 9 feet. How much deeper is the water than Dean's height?", "correct answer": 81.0, "llm answer": "9 feet", "confidence": 0.15, "probing response": "15%\n\nSolution: They go swimming after resting so that means they have a greater physical energy and strength to dive deeper than usual. We know Dean can dive at 9 feet under water so if they were to dive, it would make sense that they would dive deeper than 9 feet. Although if they have very little strength to dive, then it would be logical that they would have difficulty diving deeper. They may have the strength to dive 10 feet because they can dive 9 feet but the problem states that the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height which means that if he stands at 9 feet, then the water is 90 feet deep. Therefore the depth of the water is more than 9 feet, but not by just one foot as the answer 9 feet states. It must be a larger number, such as 10 feet or 11 feet, which is a deeper depth and thus a better answer to this problem.\n\nIf we use the format for reasoning:\n\nThe answer 9 feet is wrong because the problem states that the depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height and he stands at 9 feet. Thus the depth of the water is 90 feet and not 9 feet, which is the answer given."}

Now she has 15 left. How many fishes disappeared?\n\nIn total, she had 7+12=19 fishes, but now she has 15 left, so 4 disappeared. The answer is 4.\n\nThe above solution seems simple and direct. However, this problem can also be solved in other ways. \n\nLet's look at the problem again, let A be the number of goldfish that Paige had raised, and B the number of catfish that Paige had raised. Because she has 15 fishes left, we can derive the following equation:\nA+B-15=4\nWe can subtract A from both sides of the equation and let X be the number of catfish that disappeared:\nB-15+4=X\nNow we have X=19-B\nTherefore, the number of goldfish that disappeared was 19-B-A=19-B-(7+12)=19-B-19=19-19=0.\n\nBased on the above two methods, the number of fish that disappeared is either 4 or 0. In fact, it is not difficult to find that if there are 4 fish disappeared"}

Why?\n\n- In a confidence interval, the margin of error is not a fixed value, but depends on the sample size. It decreases as the sample size increases. Therefore, if you are doing a large survey, then confidence interval is a better choice because it produces a narrower confidence interval as the sample size increases. - In a confidence approach, the margin of error is a fixed value. Even if you increase the sample size, you are still bound to this fixed margin of error. Therefore, if you are doing a small survey, then confidence approach is a better choice because you can calculate the exact probability of your answer being correct.\n"}

How many push-ups did John do?", "correct answer": 69.0, "llm answer": "69", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation:\nThe equation for the number of push-ups is $$n = 51+ 22 + 4 - d$$. 4 represents the number of push-ups David did more than John. 22 represents the number of push-ups David did more than Zachary. This is represented by $22 = n - 51$. d is the unknown number of push-ups John did.\n\nTherefore $$n = 51+ 22 + 4 - d = 69 - d$$. Thus the number of push-ups John did was 69 push-ups.\n\nI think I may not have expressed this clearly. I don't think you are wrong, I think the question is poorly stated.\n\nI think it should say that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. And John did 4 push-ups less than David.\n\n$$n = 51+ 22 - 4 - d$$\n\nOr it should say John did 4 push-ups less than Zachary, in which case\n\n$$n = 51 + 4 - d$$\n\nSo David did 55 push-ups. \n\nYou are right, my bad.

Now there are 3 + 26 - 2 = 27 bird families.\n* 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. -> The 2 families were also arctic birds. So the total number of birds that came from the arctic is 26 + 2 = 28.

He has 12 houses in his block, so he would need to work 12 days at 48 pieces a day to distribute the 160 pieces.\nHe is distributing 48 pieces every hour.

Let $x$ be the number of cars worth at least $9,300. Let $y$ be the number of cars worth less than$9,300. Then $x+y=2000$ and $y(8900)+(x)(9300)=17900000$. The first equation gives $y=2000-x$.

The answer can not be 36, because there are not enough students in the school. Therefore, the answer can be from 1 to 35. There are more students than seats on the buses. To solve this problem, I first subtracted the total number of students (111) from the number of seats (111/3). Then I divided the number (35) by the number of seats (3). The number I got (11.67) was more than the total number of classrooms (72). So I subtracted (72-11.67=60.33) from the total number of students.

{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nSolution\nThe ratio of cups of sugar to cups of flour is 5 to 14, and thus the ratio of sugar to flour is 5/14. (If we had wanted to find the ratio of cups of flour to cups of sugar, we would divide 14 by 5, and we'd get 2 2/5, a ratio of 2 2/5:1.) The number of cups of sugar to cups of flour that Mary has already added is 0 cups of sugar and 11 cups of flour, which is the ratio 0/11. The ratio of sugar to flour that Mary needs to add is the ratio 5/14 minus the ratio 0/11, and that's (5/14)-(0/11)=(5/14)-(0/11)=5/14-(0/11)=(5/11)/14, or (5/11)/14, which can be simplified to 5/11.\n\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 3 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\n\nThe correct answer is that Mary needs to add 3 cups of sugar for every 11 cups of flour, and so"}

Both increase their amount of money.\nSecond, Fred earns money for his car washing and Jason spends money for some other thing.\nWe can check the two cases as follows.\nFirst, Fred has 112 dollars after car washing, while Jason has 63 dollars, which means that Jason earns 60 dollars for his newspaper delivering. The question says that Jason earns $3 dollars less than Fred, thus he earns 57 dollars.\nSecond, Jason spends 3 dollars and Fred spends 50 dollars. Now Fred has 62 dollars, while Jason has 63 dollars, which means that Jason earns 1 dollars for his newspaper delivering. The question says that Jason earns 3 dollars less than Fred, thus he earns -2 dollars.\nSince Jason earns 57 dollars or -2 dollars, the only answer is 63 dollars."}

Rebecca has 10 marbles and 15 eggs. The answer to the above question is 3 groups. The probability of creating 5 groups from a group of 15 is 0, because 15 is not a multiple of 5. The probability of creating 4 groups from a group of 15 is 0, because 15 is not a multiple of 4. The probability of creating 3 groups from a group of 15 is 1, because 15 is a multiple of 5. The probability of creating 2 groups from a group of 15 is 0, because 15 is not a multiple of 2. The probability of creating 1 group from a group of 15 is 0, because 15 is not a multiple of 1.

We need to find the total number of sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days of harvest.\nWe can use the formula for finding the sum of consecutive integers to solve this problem. The formula is:\n$$S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$$\nWhere S is the sum of consecutive integers, n is the number of integers, a is the first integer, and l is the last integer.\nIn this problem, n is 6 (the number of days they harvest), a is 65 (the number of sacks of unripe oranges they harvest each day), and l is 65 (the last day of harvest). Therefore, the formula becomes:\n$$S = \\frac{6}{2}(65 + 65)$$\n$$S = 6(130)$$\n$$S = 780$$\nSo, the total number of sacks of unripe oranges they will have after 6 days of harvest is 780."}

Robin is a person. In order to know which Robin is which, we can say \"The Robin has 21 packs of gum\".\n\n2. The number of packs of gum is 21, and there are 45 packs of candy. Since this is a number sentence, it should be 21 + 45, but it is not because this is an English sentence and does not use the same math operations as the number sentence. Instead, this sentence shows a comparison of how many packs of gum Robin has to how many packs of candy Robin has. Robin has more packs of candy than packs of gum, so this sentence can also be written as 45 - 21.\n\n3. Each pack contains 9 pieces of candy. If we want to know how many pieces there are, we need to multiply 9 x 45.\n\n4. The answer is 405. Since Robin only has packs of gum and packs of candy, we don't have any pieces of gum.

The graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs (or more commonly x and y values) where the first coordinate is an element in the domain of the function and the second coordinate is its image.\n\nIn the graph of a function, the horizontal axis is the x-axis and the vertical axis is the y-axis. Any point that is not on the graph of a function is called a point of discontinuity. For instance, a vertical line that intersects the graph of a function in only one point at a time is a point of discontinuity. A vertical line that intersects the graph of a function at more than one point is not a point of discontinuity.\n\nOn the x-axis of a function, there are two points that are not in the domain of the function. The x-axis is called the y-axis because it is the x-coordinate of the function. Because the function is a function of x, the x-axis is the domain of the function.\n\nOn the y-axis, the x-axis is not in the domain of the function. The y-axis is called the y"}

If we can also assume equal number of candies in all bags and 28 candies are in each bag, then 14 bags with 28 candies gives 392 candies. Since the total number of candies is 86, there must be 306 candies left. So there are 306 candies and 14 bags. This means that 306 candies are divided by 14 bags, which gives 21.85 candies per bag.

The correct answer is very likely 4. I don't know the probability, but I think it is close to 50% because the answer is not too far from the number of rows and there are not many pencils. So I guess it is close to 50% which is 15% according to my opinion.\n\nExplanation:\n* The explanation for this question should be a concise description of the reasoning process used to arrive at the chosen answer, including any relevant calculations or formulas. In this case, the reasoning process can be described as follows:\n1. Determine the total number of pencils to be placed into 3 rows: 12 pencils\n2. Divide the total number of pencils by the number of rows to find the number of pencils per row: 12 pencils / 3 rows = 4 pencils per row\n3.

How many more tickets did Dave use to buy toys than he did to buy clothes?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nComment\n\nIn general, I think this question is a great example for demonstrating how Bayesian updating can be applied to probabilistic reasoning. In this case, it requires the student to know that they should update their confidence based on the fact that they won 19 tickets. The problem statement is a bit convoluted and should probably be reworded.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFirst, I'll set up the possible worlds:\n\n• $$w_1$$ : Dave has 12 tickets for toys and 7 for clothes\n• $$w_2$$ : Dave has 14 tickets for toys and 5 for clothes\n• $$w_3$$ : Dave has 16 tickets for toys and 3 for clothes\n• $$w_4$$ : Dave has 18 tickets for toys and 1 for clothes\n• $$w_5$$ : Dave has 20 tickets for toys and 0 for clothes\n\nNext, I'll define the probability distribution over the possible worlds as follows:\n\n• $$P(w_1) = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n• $$P(w_2) = \\frac{2}{5}$$\n• $$P(w_3) = \\frac{1}{5}$$\n• $$P(w_"}

The total weight of wax needed is 10 times 3 which is 30 grams. Therefore the total weight of wax needed is 30 grams. Subtracting 17 from 30 you have 13 grams of wax left. Dividing 13 by 10 will give you 1.3. Now that you have the amount of wax used on each feather and the total amount of wax needed, you need to subtract those numbers from 557 to find how much wax is left. 557 grams - 30 grams - 13 grams = 540 grams\n```"}

It did not specify how many bottle caps he had at the beginning. If there was no reference of the number of bottle caps he had, then it would be impossible to determine how many bottle caps he found at the park. However, since it was specified that he had 25 bottle caps, then the number of bottle caps he found at the park can be calculated by subtracting 25 from the total number of bottle caps (32).

How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "-2 cups", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\n---\nMy reasoning: The number of cups of sugar is the multiple of 11 and the number of cups of flour is the multiple of 6. The number of cups of flour must be 6 times that of flour, as there are 6 cups of flour. As such, the sugar must be 11 times as much as the sugar. To find out the number of cups of salt, we first need to find out the number of cups of salt, and divide it by 9.\nAs such, 6 times 11 = 66 cups of sugar.\nThe number of cups of flour has to be a multiple of 6, and therefore cannot be 12 cups of flour. As such, 6 does not divide into 12 evenly.\n6 times 11 cannot be 12.\nTherefore, there is no valid combination that can be the answer."}

Then I subtracted how many he lost, 231, from this amount. Then I found how many he gave to friends, 308. I subtracted the amount he lost from the amount he gave away to friends and found the answer to be 77, the amount of crayons he gave away to friends more than he lost. However, this is not the answer the question asked for. The question asked for the amount of crayons he gave to friends more than he lost. He gave more to his friends than he lost, so the amount of crayons he gave to his friends more than he lost is positive. The answer they have given is negative. Therefore, the answer is incorrect.\n"}

Let $A$ be the event that the first die shows a certain number, say $n$. Let $B$ be the event that the second die shows the same number. To find $P(A) = P(n)$, we find the probability of 1/6, or (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6. To find $P(B)$, we can use the fact that we have 36 combinations of pairs of two dice with six faces.

How many more movies do you still have to watch?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nSolution: \n\nThe total number of options is 4 x 17 = 68, of which the books and movies are all distinct. We then remove 19 books and 7 movies, leaving 68 - 19 - 7 = 42 books and movies. Out of these 42 books and movies, we have to watch all 7 movies that we have not seen, plus some books. Thus, the answer is 7. The probability that the given answer is correct is simply the number of options that result in the answer of 7 over the total number of options. This is (68 - 19 - 7) / 68 = 42 / 68 = 0.618, or approximately 61.8%. (This can be simplified slightly by noting that the total number of options includes both distinct books and distinct movies. Since each book can also be a movie, we have 4 + 17 = 21 options that could be either.

If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week. How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season? \nSolution: \nFirst, we will find the total amount of money that Lewis earned during the 1359 weeks of harvest. Then, we will find the total amount of money that Lewis paid in rent during the 1359 weeks of harvest. Finally, we will subtract the total amount of money that Lewis paid in rent from the total amount of money that he earned during the 1359 weeks of harvest to find the amount of money that he paid in rent during the harvest season.\nLet x be the number of weeks in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we have x=52. Therefore, the total amount of money that Lewis earned during the 1359 weeks of harvest is $368*x=$368*52=$18928.

How many bottles did they have total?", "correct answer": 110.0, "llm answer": "110", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0.0%\n```Answer: 110```\nExplanation:\nThe question asked is to find out how many bottles of soda the grocery store had in total. This means that it is the combination of all three types of soda. The easiest way to solve this is to add the three categories up, so we get $57+26+27=110$ bottles of soda. Therefore the correct answer is 110. \nThe reason I chose this answer is because it is the easiest way to add up the three categories. If I had chosen a different answer such as 56, then I would need to do more work to add up the three categories. This is because 56 is not one of the options given in the question, so I would need to find out which category that corresponds to, then subtract that category from 110. This takes more time and effort, so I chose the option which was quickest and easiest. \nTherefore, my confidence in this answer is 100% as it is the easiest way to solve this problem."}

I think this makes sense because if the problem were meant to refer to the number of peaches Steven has, then it would have said something like \"Jill has 8 fewer peaches than Steven\".

The baker has 140-92=48 cakes sold. If he had more than 48 pastries, then the baker would have sold 48+1 cakes. If he had less than 48 pastries, then the baker would have sold 48-1 cakes. The only time this scenario would be possible is if the baker had 48 pastries. If the baker had 48 pastries, then he would have sold 48+1=49 pastries. Since this scenario is not possible, then the baker had 49-1=48 pastries. Thus, the baker had 134-48=86 pastries to sell. Since 42 pastries were left over and 86 pastries were sold, then 86-42=44 pastries were sold. If the baker had 44 pastries, then he would have sold 140+44=184 pastries.

We are asked to find the length of the jump made by the frog.\n\nFirst, let’s draw the relationship between the three jumps and find the total distance traveled by the three.\n\nLet x be the length of the grasshopper’s jump, which is given as 19 inches.\n\nLet y be the length of the frog’s jump. According to the information given, we know that y is 39 inches greater than x.\n\nWe can then write the equation:\n\ny = 39 + x\n\nNext, let z be the length of the mouse’s jump. According to the information given, we know that z is 94 inches less than y.\n\nWe can then write the equation:\n\nz = y – 94\n\nSubstituting the value of y into the equation, we get:\n\nz = 39 + x – 94\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nz = – 55 + x\n\nNow, we know that the total distance traveled by the three is 19 + 39 + (-55).\n\nWe can then write the equation:\n\n19 + 39 + (-55) = 3"}

{"question": "After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day.

How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?", "correct answer": 274.0, "llm answer": "274", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:\nI think the question is asking for the last day, but it doesn't specifically say so. For the sake of argument, I'll say the question is about the previous day, i.e., 326 days prior. Since the palace receives about 1320 visitors per year, the expected number of visitors in 326 days would be (326/365)*1320 = 436.5. The actual number of visitors over that period was 406. The mean of a binomial distribution is mu = np, where p = (actual/expected)*mu. This gives us p = 406/436.5*1320/365 = 406/436.5*.3642. Using the standard binomial distribution, the probability of 274 (or any particular number of visitors) on the previous day is 0.5%, but the question doesn't tell us that this is the number of visitors we are interested in. The 0.5% is based on a normal approximation of a binomial distribution. Using the normal distribution, the z-score is (274-405.8)/9.98 = -4.17. The probability of a z-score less than -4.17 is 2.3x"}

Thus, any of the options could be correct, but with various probabilities. We can assume that the number of pickers has a Poisson distribution (the only possible correct answer is the number of drums of grapes). 252 is a pretty reasonable pick, which, for a Poisson distribution, implies that the average number of pickers per day is ~100. 57 is a reasonable number of days to have grape harvest. With 100 pickers, it's very unlikely that we get more than 100 drums per day (which is why option A can be discarded). 100 pickers, 57 days gives us 100 * 57 ~ 5700 drums per day, which is why option B is not plausible. With 252 pickers, 57 days give us ~14,400 drums per day, which is why option D is also not plausible. Thus, there is a very small chance that the correct answer is option C. Option E is plausible with the pickers number following the Poisson distribution, but we don't know if it is correct. Thus,"}
