If there are 6 blue shirts and 17 green shirts, we can divide the total shirts by the number of shirts for blue shirts. This gives 23/6=3.83 or about 4. So we can deduce that there are 4 blue shirts and 17-4=13 green shirts. This is a 13/23=57% chance of correct. If Gavin has 2 blue shirts, he would have 21-2=19 green shirts. This is a 19/23=83% chance of correct. But if Gavin has 3 blue shirts, he would have 20-3=17 green shirts, which has a 100% chance of correct. \n\n2.

How many miles did they have left to drive?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "46", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\n```Reasoning:\nThe reason I selected '46 miles' is because 32+46=78. Since the problem states that 'they drove 32 miles and then stopped for gas', this implies that 46 miles remains and they can travel it by putting 28 gallons of gas in the car.\n\nExplanation:\n\n```The question asks how many miles did they have left to drive after they drove 32 miles and stopped for gas. This implies that they have traveled 32 miles and they are now at the gas station. Since the question states they are putting 28 gallons of gas in the car, the question implies that this is the number of miles that the car can travel with 28 gallons of gas. The question implies that 32 miles is what the car has traveled and they now have 28 gallons of gas in the car. By subtracting the number of miles the car has traveled (32 miles) from the number of miles the car can travel with 28 gallons of gas (46 miles), the answer 46-32=14. The question asks how many miles they have left to drive, and this implies that they have traveled 32 miles, and now have 28 gallons of gas, which implies that they can travel 46 miles"}

How much money did she pay for all of the hot dogs?", "correct answer": 300.0, "llm answer": "$3", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100% \n\nIn this question, we know that $3 is the cost of 6 hot dogs, where each hot dog costs 50 cents. We can represent this information as 6 × 50 = 300, which means that Mrs. Hilt paid a total of $3 for all of the hot dogs. This reasoning is straightforward and consistent with the provided information, making the answer of $3 the most likely choice.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the provided answer of $3 is highly likely to be correct, with a confidence level of 100%.\n\nLet's also consider a slightly different scenario, where Mrs. Hilt buys 6 hot dogs, but each hot dog costs 40 cents instead of 50 cents. In this case, the correct answer would be $2.40 instead of $3. This suggests that the answer of $3 is not necessarily correct in every context.\n\nTo summarize, based on the given information, I believe that the answer of $3 is highly likely to be correct. However, it is important to consider the context of the problem and adjust our reasoning accordingly to ensure that we provide a correct and accurate answer."}

Therefore, we can conclude that his sister's birthday is in the 2nd half of the month + 14 days. If we were to count forward from February 1st, the 14th day is the 7th. Therefore, his sister's birthday must be on the 7th. Since February is the 2nd month of the year, the 7th day is the 7th day of the 2nd month, or February 7th."}

The keywords about '3' and '45' gives us a clue about the units of time. The keywords about the word 'time' gives us more clues on how to reason. As such, we have reason to believe that the units of time in question might be minutes. Now that we have an idea about the units, we can translate the question as such: \"What time will it be after three hours and forty-five minutes?\" To solve the problem, we can take into account that one hour is 60 minutes, we have three hours and forty-five minutes in total. 3h x 60 = 180 45min x 1 = 45 So the total is 225 minutes in total. Now we can consider how many 60s of minutes are in this total. 225 / 60 = 3 and a half Therefore, the time in question should be 3 hours and a half or 3.5 hours away from 2:00. Therefore, the time in question is 5:45. And that concludes our reasoning.\n\n"}

How many ounces of paint would they buy in total?", "correct answer": 69.0, "llm answer": "69", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: Since it is given that the Treehouse is almost done, so it is clear that we don't need to paint the whole surface of the treehouse. In other words, we only need to paint the surface area of the treehouse. And the question doesn't provide any information about the surface area of the treehouse, hence it is impossible to compute the correct number of total ounces of paint they would buy.\n\nHowever, as they need 20 ounces of white paint, 15 ounces of green paint and 34 ounces of brown paint, then it is clear that the painter needs to paint the surface area with all three colors. In this situation, it is more likely to assume the total surface area of the treehouse, by rounding the ounces of paint they would buy to the nearest integer. Then the painter would need to buy at least 20 ounces of white paint, at least 15 ounces of green paint and at least 34 ounces of brown paint to ensure they would have enough paint for the job. With these values, the total ounces of paint they would buy is 20 + 15 + 34 = 69, which is the correct answer to this question.\n\nAs the above reasoning can only give the painter the correct number of"}

The question is asking for the total number of cookies eaten, so we need to add up the cookies eaten by Charlie, his father, and his mother. \n\nOnce we understand the question, we can start solving the problem by adding up the cookies eaten by each person. Charlie ate 15 cookies, his father ate 10, and his mother only ate 5. So, the total number of cookies eaten is 15 + 10 + 5 = 30. \n\nFinally, we can confirm that our answer is correct by checking that the total number of cookies matches the given information. Since 30 is the total number of cookies eaten, our answer is correct. \n\nOverall, the key to solving this problem is to carefully read the question and then use addition to find the total number of cookies eaten. \n```"}

Based on the keywords, it seems likely that the protagonist needs to fill the hole with 823 gallons of water - 676 gallons to fill the hole. But this doesn't quite make sense. If the hole currently has 676 gallons of water, and the protagonist needs to fill the hole with 823 gallons of water, then he would need to bring 823 gallons of water with him. But the third sentence specifically says that the protagonist already has 823 gallons of water. This means that the protagonist already has enough water to fill the hole.

How much farther is the island from the 2nd stopover?", "correct answer": 68.0, "llm answer": "68", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\nExplanation: If the answer is correct, that would mean the distance from the 2nd stopover is 368 miles and Katie is 68 miles away from the island. We know this is possible, but unlikely. If the answer is wrong, that would mean that Katie is 8 miles away from the island and the 2nd stopover is 428 miles away from the island.

The fact that it is not given in the question that miles is a unit of length helps to support your guess.\n\nYou might guess that Amanda and her friends covered 3 hours worth of speed at 27 miles per hour.

This will be a number of 72 stickers that will be divided by 9 people.\n\nTo calculate the number, we first do basic math of 9x+72. By basic math, we get 9x to be 72-72=0. And therefore, the equation of 9x+72 can be reduced to 0+72=72. Therefore, the number of stickers Haley has is 72. \n\nWith that, we now calculate 72/9 to get the number of stickers each person will get. By basic math, we get 72/9=8.

If x and y are equal, then 3x + 3y is 6x. So 4x = 6x and so x = 3.\n\nNote that the possible answer was just a random number between 1 and 10. We used it as a value to test whether the reasoning for the question is valid. If the reasoning is invalid, the keyword information may still be used to deduce the answer. But if the reasoning is valid, even if the answer given is not correct, it may still be close to the correct answer. For example, the answer 4 has an equation x = 5, y = z = 3 (which solves the original problem) and may also be possible for the answer 3.\n\n"}

Then '34 - 30 = 4' and '6 ÷ 4 = 1 R 2' suggest that there are 34 objects and 4 groups, so if we share them equally, each group should get 2 objects, and we should have 2 objects left. Since 2 left is the same as 2 left, the answer should be correct."}
{"question": "Martha bought 18 small cakes. She has 3 children. She would like to divide the cakes among her children so that each child gets the same amount. How many cakes would each child get?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n```Confidence: 50%```\n```Confidence: 90%```\nExplanation:\nWe reason as follows: Martha has 18 cakes. She would like to divide the cakes among her 3 children. We know how to divide: 18 divided by 3 = 6 and therefore Martha would give each child 6 cakes. However, we know the answer is wrong because the answer asks for Martha to divide 18 cakes between 3 children, and it asks to divide the cakes equally, meaning that each child would get the same amount of cakes. It is not possible for each child to get 6 cakes each, because 6 cakes divided by 3 children = 2 cakes per child, but then we would have 18 cakes - 6 cakes = 12 cakes left. Martha has not eaten any of the cakes, so we know she had all 18 cakes in the beginning. In this case, Martha has less cakes than we expected, so each child must not have 6 cakes each. 2 cakes per child is the correct answer.\n\nPossible Alternative Answer: 3\nKeywords during reasoning to the possible answer: ['1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18', '18"}

This question contains a mathematical calculation, but we need to understand that we are asked how many \"tee-shirts\" we can make with 60 feet of material. In other words, we are calculating how many units of something (tee-shirts) we can make with 60 feet of material.\nWe start with 4 feet of material which can be used to make one tee-shirt, so 4 feet = 1 tee-shirt. We need to consider how many 4 feet pieces we can get from 60 feet. 60/4=15, so we can make 15 pieces with 60 feet.\nWe know that 4 feet is used to make one tee-shirt, so 4 times 15 = 60, meaning we can make 15 tee-shirts with 60 feet of material.\n\n"}

This kind of reasoning is widely used in everyday life to solve everyday problems. For example, if you have never seen an elephant before, you can still infer some of its physical characteristics by comparing it with other animals you have seen, such as a giraffe, a horse, and a monkey.\nThe same principle can be applied to mathematical problem solving as well. For example, when comparing two triangles, you can look for the side lengths, angle measurements, and area measurements that are the same to determine if they are congruent or similar.\n# 2.4.3 Reasoning by Abstraction\nReasoning by abstraction is useful when solving a problem that has no direct solution. It is a method that allows you to find a solution to a problem by simplifying it into smaller and more manageable parts.\nThis method is especially useful when solving a problem with a large number of variables or when the problem involves complex logic or calculations. Reasoning by abstraction is a common practice in mathematical problem solving and can be applied to other fields such as engineering,"}

How many total miles did they drive?", "correct answer": 1250.0, "llm answer": "1250 miles", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe have the sentence: The Sumata family took a five-day vacation by car. Each day they drove 250 miles. How many total miles did they drive?\n\nTo calculate the number of miles driven by the family in total, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of miles driven per day. This gives 5*250 = 1250 miles.\n\nWe multiply because we want to find the sum of miles driven in each day, which is the number of days times the number of miles driven per day.\n\nThis reasoning is in accordance with the keywords, as we are performing a multiplication operation with the numbers 5 and 250 to find the total number of miles driven.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is indeed 1250 miles, and the reasoning process above explains why.\n\nQ: What if I gave you the keywords [1 day, 250 miles]?\nAnswer: [250 miles]\n\nQ: What if I gave you the keywords [5 days, 250 miles, 1250 miles]?\nAnswer: [1250 miles]\n\nQ: What if I gave you the keywords [1 day, 250 miles, 5 days]?\nAnswer: [1250 miles]\n\nQ: What if I gave you"}

So to find the cost of 4 stamps, we must add 0.34 three times to the cost of 1 stamp. This gives us 1.02 + 0.34 + 0.34 + 0.34 = 1.36. This is an algebraic approach to solve the problem.\n\nQ: One stamp costs $0.34. Two stamps cost $0.68. Three stamps cost $1.02.

We are also provided with keywords such as \"280 - 212\", which suggests that the correct answer is 68.\n\nHowever, I find this reasoning to be highly flawed and unlikely to be correct. Here's why:\n\n1. The keyword \"280 - 212\" suggests that we should simply subtract the two numbers to find the answer, but that is not the only way to solve this problem. We could also use addition or multiplication to find the answer.\n\n2. Even if we use subtraction, the answer of 68 seems too simple to be correct. It's possible that the author meant to include a negative sign before the 68, which would change the answer to -68. This would make sense if we were subtracting 212 from 280, but it's unclear from the given information.\n\n3. The answer of 68 does not seem to make sense in the context of the problem.

After he lost 4 books, he still had X-4 books. After his dad gave him 10 more books, he had X-4+10= X+6 books. After he lost 10 books, he had X-10 books. After his dad gave him 10 more books, he had X-10+10 = X books. The question tells us that after Bruno's dad gave him more books, Bruno had 39 books. Therefore, X=39, so he had 39-10+10=39 books at first. Bruno had 39 books at first and had 39-4=35 books after he lost 4 books. His dad gave him 10 more books, so he had 35+10=45 books, which does not equal 39. Bruno had 39 books at first and had 39-10=29 books after he lost 10 books. His dad gave him 10 more books, so he had 29+10=39 books, which equals 39. So the answer is 25.```\n\nQ: Bruno had some story books. He lost 4 of them and his dad gave him 10"}

{"question": "Harry walked along the beach and collected 34 sea stars, 21 seashells and 29 snails. He lost some of the items and had 59 items left at the end of his walk. How many sea creatures did he lose in all?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "25", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: \nFor this problem, we can consider that each item Harry collected is the same. Therefore, each type of sea creature has an equal probability of being lost. Thus, if we define $X$ as the random variable representing the number of creatures lost, then $X$ is binomially distributed with $n = 34 + 21 + 29 = 84$ and $p = \\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the expected value is $E(X) = np = 84 * \\frac{1}{3} = 28$, and the standard deviation is $\\sqrt{np(1-p)} = \\sqrt{84 * \\frac{1}{3} * \\frac{2}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{56}{3}} \\approx 3.42$. Therefore, the standard deviation is about three times the expected value, and the probability of having 59 or more losses is extremely unlikely, especially since we don't have much information about the distribution of $X$ (the only thing we can infer from the problem is that $X$ is positive). Thus, the answer is 25.\n"}

We can also get this amount by multiplying 728 by 32. 728 x 32 = 696. This is because there are 32 gallons in the tank and 728 is the total number of gallons. Since we now have 696 gallons, we can divide that amount by 32 to find the number of gallons that are in the tank that is not full. 696 ÷ 32 = 21.75. This is the possible answer.\n\nQ: How is the confidence value calculated?\nFor each keyword, we first calculate the log likelihood ratio of its occurrence in the problem statement and the answer, respectively.

I considered that dividing a number evenly is the same as the number of equal groups that could be made with that number. This heuristic was not able to deal with fractional parts of the number that were left over.\n\n```4.4 / 5 = 0.88``` so that leaves 0.2 laptops that can't be distributed evenly. \n\nSo if I'm wrong the answer would have to be either 8 or 10.\nThe answer can't be 10 because 4.4 + 4.4 = 8.8 not 10.0.

{"question": "Divide 39 balloons into 7 equal groups. How many balloons are left?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "5 balloons are left", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe first step for reasoning is to determine if all the keywords are helpful to the reasoning process.\nSince 39 is an odd number, we can divide it by 7 without remainder. This implies that we can divide the balloons into 5 groups of 7 and one group of 6. Hence, the correct answer is 6 balloons.\nHowever, we need to determine the possible answers. The keywords give us two important numbers to think about.\n5.57 balloons is between 5 and 6 balloons. The other keyword 39 balloons give us a rough idea about the difference between the answers. If we add 5.57 balloons to 5 balloons, we will get 10.57 balloons which is much closer to 6 balloons than to 5 balloons. Therefore, 5.57 balloons suggests that the possible answers are 5 and 6 balloons.\n\nThe next step is to think through the given keywords. We know that there is a big difference between the two possible answers. So, we should determine which one is more reasonable, based on our experience and intuition.\nIn this question, 5 balloons suggests that the balloons are all equally divided and 6 balloons suggests that there is one extra balloon.

If `315/218` is smaller than `1/1`, it is more likely that 218 is the correct answer. In another word, `315/218 < 1/1`.\nSince `315/218 = 1*218/218 = 1/1`, we conclude 218 is the correct answer.\n```"}

We can make 5/2 a whole number by multiplying by 2; 2(5/2) = 5. 5/2 is greater than 5, so we need more than 5 plates. If we buy 6, then 6(5/2) = 10, which means that 6 is a multiple of 10; since we already have 6 packages of cups, then we should buy the same amount for plates and we should have 6 plates to go with the 6 cups."}

How many more marbles did Drew have than Marcus at first?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation: This is a very straightforward question in that we just need to know that\n$12 + x = 25$\n\nto solve for x, which is $13$, and then we subtract $12$ and $13$, which gives us the result of $1$.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the question actually gives us more information than necessary to solve the problem, so it's quite hard to say what Drew's starting number of marbles was or if Marcus ever had an equal number of marbles as Drew.\n\nThe fact that Drew gave away $12$ marbles tells us that Drew's starting number was at least $13$ more than Marcus's initial number. And since Drew still had $25$ marbles after giving them away, that means Marcus started with at most $12$ marbles. But, if we assume that Drew's initial number was the largest possible starting number and Marcus's was the smallest, we get that Drew's initial number is $25$ and Marcus's is $12$.\n\nSo, assuming that Drew's initial number is the largest possible and Marcus's is the smallest, then Drew's initial number would be $25$ and Marcus's would be $12$.

How many pages are in Suzanne's book altogether?", "correct answer": 64.0, "llm answer": "49", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: The most important part of this question is to realize that M is Suzanne's reading on Monday (pages read on M). Then, on Tuesday, she read 16 pages more than she did on Monday (16M), and then there were 18 pages left. So, we can say that 15 + 16M + 18 = X, where X is the total number of pages. Then, to solve, we can set up an equation to solve for M and from there find the total. We do this by writing 15 + 16M + 18 = X. This then simplifies to 18 + 15 + 16M = X, or just 33 + 16M = X. Now, we can say that M = 33 / 16 = 2.06. So, Suzanne read 2.06 pages on Monday and 16 pages more than that on Tuesday. So, she read 2.06 + 16 = 18.06 pages. Thus, Suzanne has read a total of 15 + 18.06 = 33.06 pages. Thus, there are 49 pages left. Thus, Suzanne's book has 15 + 16M + 18"}

From the problem, we have $n$ apples at first, and 1/2 of them are left after putting aside, which leaves $n \\times 1/2$ apples. Now that we have $n \\times 1/2$ apples left, 25 of them are put in the refrigerator. This gives us $n \\times 1/2 - 25$ apples to use in muffins, and we know that 6 of these are used in muffins, which gives us $n \\times 1/2 - 25 - 6$ apples. We can reorganize this into $n - 25 - 12$ apples, which is $n - 37$ apples. The total number of apples must be greater than $n - 37$, so it must be 50 or higher.

Now, we have to focus on the second game where Alvin won 25 marbles. Since he has only 39 marbles left, it means that if he had started with 39 marbles, he would have won 25 marbles, and this would give him 39 + 25 = 64 marbles in total. Therefore, the correct answer is 64.\n\nHowever, if the given information was that Alvin started with 57 marbles and won 25 marbles during the second game, the correct answer would still be 64, as we would then have to subtract 25 from 57 to"}

The statement said \"sold 15 more cook books than computer books\", which means:\n  - there are two types of books, `cook` and `computer`, and\n  - the amount of `cook` books the Book Nook sold is 15 more than the `computer` books the Book Nook sold\n\n2. In the statement of the question, it says: `The Book Nook sold 27 computer books last week`. So it means:\n  - The Book Nook sold 27 `computer` books last week, and\n  - The Book Nook must also have sold `cook` books last week.\n\n3. If we are to apply the 2nd point to the 1st point, we would have:\n  - The Book Nook sold 27 `computer` books last week, and\n  - The Book Nook also sold `cook` books last week, and\n  - The amount of `cook` books sold must be 15 more than 27, or 15 + 27 = 42. That is:\n    - 42 `cook` books were sold by the Book Nook last week\n\n### Reference\n1. The answer"}

So Emma has 82 - 70 = 12 minutes before her mom arrives home and 82 - 48 = 34 minutes after. Since she has to go home before her mom arrives and has to go to gymnastics at 6:00 p.m., she has 12 + 34 = 46 minutes. Now, she has to add in 12 minutes for the time her mom arrives, because the question only asks about how much time she has *after* her mom arrives. So, the answer is 46 + 12 = 58 minutes. This is much greater than 38, so the answer is clearly incorrect.\n\nNow, we could do a quick sanity check with the keywords to make sure this answer doesn't make sense: 70 + 12 minutes is almost 6:00, so this makes sense, but it seems much too long to go to gymnastics. 70 + 4 is 2"}

The volume of the punch bowl is 3 times the volume of the orange juice which is half of the punch bowl. So, we have 0.5(3hwl) = 0.75. Then, we can solve for the volume. hwl = 1.2 liters.```\n\nSolution: \n```The question can be solved in two ways: \n1. Volume of orange juice = (1/2) x 1/2 x bowl, so (1/4) x bowl. Volume of grape juice = (1/2) x (1/2) x bowl, so (1/4) x bowl. Volume of cherry juice = (1/2) x (1/2) x (1/2) x bowl, so (1/8) x bowl. So, total volume = (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8) x bowl = (3/8) x bowl.

If we were to solve the question in the most simple way, we'd just divide the original cost by 0.18 to get the marked price. The correct answer would be 816.67.\nHowever, when we are reasoning with keywords, we have to think about the keywords, how they relate to each other, and how they fit into the equation.\nFrom the keywords, we know that there is a 18% discount on the original price of the blouse. This means that if the marked price was $100, we'd multiply 100 by 0.18 to get 18. So now we know that \"0.18 * P\" is the discount.\nWe also know that the marked price divided by the discount equals the original price. In other words, \"P / 0.18\" is the original price. We can then rearrange the terms of the equation and solve for P. (0.18 * P) / 0.18 = (147.60 / 0.18). 0.18P / 0.18 = 820. So the marked price is 820.```"}

I know that the first job pays more than the second job so I should try to compare $375 with a multiple of the second job's amount. That's why I need to express both jobs' amounts in the same unit so it would be easier to compare them. I'm going to express the second job's amount in terms of the first job's amount using the information that they get a total of $3,875. So let's say the second job's amount is x so: 2x = 3,875 - 375 = 3,500. The second job's amount is 1,750. Now I can express the first job's amount as: 375 + x = 2,125\n\nComment: My confidence of the possible answer depends on the second job's amount (x). It can be any number as long as 2x = 3,500.

The ratio between them is 2:3, so they are related as A = 2B/3.\nSecond, the sum of Ben's votes and Matt's votes is 60, so A+B = 60. \nThird, substituting A = 2B/3 into the equation A+B = 60 yields 2B/3+B = 60.

Since Aarav cleans 6 apartments in 2.5 hours, he cleans 6/2.5 = 2.4 apartments per hour.\nNow that we know Aarav cleans 2.4 apartments per hour, we can use the rate to find the number of hours it will take him to clean 30 apartments. We know the rate is 2.4 apartments per hour and we want to clean 30 apartments, so we have 2.4 x 30 = 72 apartments.\n72 apartments divided by 2.4 apartments per hour = 30 hours.\nSo it will take Aarav 30 hours to clean 30 apartments at this rate.\n30 hours is the same as 12.5 hours, since there are 2.5 hours in one 30 hour period.\nTherefore, it will take Aarav 12.5 hours to clean 30 apartments at this rate.```"}

How many centimeters long was the board after the carpenter cut it?", "correct answer": 519.0, "llm answer": "438 cm", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0% \n\nAnswer: We need to know two things: the length of the board before the sawing and the length cut off by the saw. But the board was 5.28 m long. How did that 9 cm get there? The board is cut in half by the saw. Then, there are two equal lengths, each 5.28 / 2 = 2.64 m long. One of them is cut in half again. This time, the length cut is 9 cm. So, after this cut, each of the remaining boards is 5.28 / 2 - 9 / 2 = 2.64 - 4.5 = 1.14 m long. Now we can add those two lengths. So, the total length of the two pieces is 1.14 * 2 = 2.28 m. Now multiply this result by 100 to convert meters to centimeters: 2.28 * 100 = 228 cm.\n\n"}

So the time could be represented in any unit. Here, we will use hours as the unit.\n\nTo calculate the time it took Hanson to get to work, we will use the subtraction method. First, we will calculate the start time, then the stop time, and finally the time it took Hanson to get to work.\n\nHanson left at 6 a.m. and got to work at 7:20 a.m. First, we will convert these times to hours using 60 minutes as the time unit. So, we can write the start time as $$6$$ and the stop time as $$7.20$$.\nNow, we will subtract these two numbers to get the time it took Hanson to get to work.\n$$7.20 - 6 = 1.20$$\n\nHowever, the question asks us to round the result to a rational number.

Therefore, the equation becomes `x = 5y/7`. Since the total quantity is the same, we have `5x + 7y = 35x`. The LHS is always divisible by 35 and the RHS is always divisible by 5. In other words, for every `x`, we can find a `y` such that the sum is divisible by 35 and 5.\n\nThe smallest `x` that satisfies this condition is 5. Therefore, `x = 5`, `y = 7/5 * 5 = 7` and the smallest number of crackers is 35.\n\n# Reasoning of the confidence\nThe keywords are used to generate the answer.

Each box has $48/7 = 6.857$ donuts. So for each box, there should be $1.857$ donuts more in each box.\n2. As a baker, he would not want to waste donuts. He would try to distribute evenly to the boxes. So he would give the first box $7$ donuts and then distribute the rest $41$ donuts evenly to the remaining $6$ boxes. Thus each box will have $41/6 \\approx 6.833$ donuts. This is $1.067$ less than the desired amount.\n3. The amount of donuts left over is $1.067 \\times 7 \\approx 7.47$, which is not an integer, so $7$ donuts are the most possible number of extra donuts.

{"question": "Candies come in packages of 4. Shirley ate 10 candies. How many candies does she have left?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2 candies", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\n**Explanation**: The 10 candies must be divided into four groups, each containing four candies. There will be two remaining candies that Shirley did not eat. The reasoning behind this is that candies come in packages of 4, meaning that there are four candies in each package. Therefore, in order to eat 10 candies, Shirley would need to eat four packages. However, she only ate 10 candies, leaving two candies remaining. This can be represented mathematically as:\n\n```\n10 = 4*2 + 2\n```\n\nwhere 4*2 is the number of candies in the four packages, and 2 is the number of remaining candies. The reasoning process behind this solution is that Shirley has 10 candies, and each package of candies contains 4 candies. Therefore, if she ate 4 packages, she would have consumed all 10 candies, leaving no candies remaining. However, if she ate less than 4 packages, she would have some candies left over. This reasoning process is based on the fact that candies come in packages of 4, and Shirley ate a certain number of candies.\n\nTherefore, considering the keywords \"candies come in packages of 4\" as additional information, the answer \"2 candies\""}

We need to think about Paige's backpack and her home. If the difference between the number of pencils in Paige's backpack and at Paige's home is -13, then the number of pencils at Paige's home must be 15 - 13 = 2. It is the same as the number of pencils in Paige's backpack. Then we don't need Paige's desk to count the number of pencils she has. We can know that the number of pencils she has is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

{"question": "A museum had fourteen paintings. After they got rid of some, they had four left. What's the difference between the number of paintings before they got rid of and the left?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nThe keywords during reasoning to the possible answer are:\n* \"after\"\n* \"they\"\n* \"got rid of\"\n* \"some\"\n* \"left\"\n\nExplanation: The question has a common structure: a museum, paintings, got rid of some, they are left. These keywords suggest that the question concerns the museum (a place) and paintings (artworks or images), and that the paintings were reduced somehow (got rid of some). The answer is correct if the difference between the number of paintings before they got rid of and the left is 10. This requires two steps: first, calculating the number of paintings that were \"got rid of\", and second, calculating the difference between this number and the number of paintings that were \"left\". The answer can be determined by reasoning that the number of paintings that were \"got rid of\" must be greater than the number of paintings that were \"left\", and that the difference between these two numbers must be the answer to the question. Therefore, the answer must be 10.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 10 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 75%\n\nThe keywords during reasoning to the possible answer"}

If we are able to find Tom's age, then we are able to find Tina's age as well.\nWe can use the age ratio $2 : 3$ as a substitution ratio:\n1. Let the common multiple of the given ratio $2 : 3$ be $x$. We can use $x$ to find Tom's age as: Tom's age $= 2x$\n2. We can use $x$ to find Tina's age as: Tina's age $= 3x$\n3. From the question's prompt, we also know that Tina's age $= 3x - 9$, since Tina is 3 years younger than Tom. So we can form the equation $3x - 9 = 3x$. Solving the equation, we have $3x - 9 = 0$, or $x = 3$.\n4. Using $x = 3$ to solve for Tom's and Tina's age, we have: Tom's age $= 2x = 2 \\times 3 = 6$ and Tina's age $= 3x = 3"}

Find the width of the cupboard.", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "10 m", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\nExplanation: The length is 6 m. The perimeter is 20 m. Since the perimeter is made of 4 sides, this is the sum of the length, width, length and width, therefore the sum of all the sides is the perimeter, that means `20 = length + width + length + width`. Subtracting twice the length we get `20 = 2 width + 2 length`. Dividing by 2 we get `10 = width + length`. This is a linear equation with two variables so it is difficult to solve directly. If we say the width is 10, then the length is 6. If we say the length is 10, then the width is 6. If we say the length is 8, then the width is 4. So far we are only guessing. We can also do some guessing based on the key words. The rectangular cupboard is of length 6 m. It says rectangular so it should be a rectangle with length of 6 m. Then we are guessing the length is 6 m, which means the width should be 4 m. But we also know that the perimeter is 20 m, so we must check if 6 m + 4 m + 6"}

There are now 90 peaches and 90 pears at the stand, how many did he pick?\" Since the question asks for how many pears did he pick, the keywords are not helpful. However, let's consider it.\nAfter picking more pears, there are now 90 peaches and 90 pears at the stand. The difference between 90 peaches and 17 pears is 73. The difference between 90 peaches and 27 pears is 63. Since there are 73 more pears than 27 pears, 73 can be the difference between 90 pears and 27 pears.\nThis reasoning is not enough to arrive at the answer, though. This is because we have no information about whether the number of peaches or the number of pears should increase.\nLet's try another reasoning.\nAfter picking more peaches, there are now 90 peaches at the stand. The difference between 90 peaches and 27 peaches is 63. The difference between 90 peaches and 17 peaches is 73"}

So, n = -5/2. Thus, today, we are 30, and he is 15.\nHowever, that is not the possible answer, so it must be a mistake.

Find the cost of each bat and each ball.", "correct answer": 500.0, "llm answer": "Each bat cost $350, and each ball cost $100.", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Answer: Let x be the price of one bat and y the price of one ball. Then 7x + 6y = 3800 and 3x + 5y = 1750. We wish to find x and y. The elimination method can be applied, eliminating y: from the first equation 7x = 3800 - 6y; and from the second equation 3x = 1750 - 5y. Hence, 3800 - 6y = 1750 - 5y. This implies that 5y - 6y = 1750 - 3800, from which it follows that y = 1000 / -1 = -1000. Now we obtain x = 3800 - 6y / 7 = 3800 - 6(-1000) / 7 = 350. Therefore, x = 350 and y = -1000, whence x = 350 and y = 100. The answer is thus that one bat costs $350 and one ball costs $100.

Therefore we know that $2w+l = 150$.\n\nWe are given that the length is $l = w+15$.\n\nSubstituting this into the perimeter equation, we have $2w+(w+15) = 150$, which can be simplified to $3w = 135$.\n\nDividing by 3 on both sides, we find that $w = 45$. Now we can calculate the length by substituting $w = 45$ into $l = w+15$, to find $l = 60$.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the perimeter using the same equation from earlier, $P = 2(45)+60 = 150$.\n\nAs the question asked for the dimensions, we find that $l = 60$ and $w = 45$."}

The area of the garden is the product of the length and width of the garden. The length and width are both 12 meters long, so the area is 12x12 = 144 square meters.\nThe pond inside the garden has an area of 20 square meters. So, we want to find the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond. In other words, we want to find the area of the garden minus the area of the pond.\nWe can subtract the area of the pond from the area of the garden to get the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond.\nArea of garden = 144 square meters\nArea of pond = 20 square meters\nArea of garden not taken up by pond = 144 - 20 = 124 square meters\nTherefore, the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond is 124 square meters.\nThis can also be reasoned as:\n1) The garden has a perimeter of 48 meters, so each side of the garden"}

We divide 516 by 9 to get the number of stacks that can be made, namely 57. Since 57 is a bit smaller than 9, it is obvious that there are extra pennies to be stacked in the last stack. There are 5 pennies less in each of the stacks before the last stack. We add up 5 more pennies to each of the other 7 stacks, bringing up the total number of pennies in the other 7 stacks to 57 + 5 = 62, which is divisible by 9. The last stack will have 516 - 5 = 511. Therefore 511 / 9 = 57, which means the remaining 5 pennies will be placed into the last stack.\n"}

And there are 13 rows, so that's 6x13, or 78, stacks. \nBecause 80-1 is 79, it means there's one stack left over. If there were 80 stacks, each with 6 in it, there would be 6x80, or 480 in the stack. 479+6=485.

Therefore, we want to solve 119 = 3x. 119 is the product of 11 and 11, which can be simplified as 1 and 9. Since George charges 3 dollars per lawn, the 1 in 119 will be covered by 3 dollars x 1 lawn. The 9 in 119 is then divided by 3, which results in 3 dollars x 3 lawns. We can then add 1 lawn to cover the leftover 1 dollar in 119. The solution is thus 3x + 1 = 119, and x = 39.

Now the answer can be 5, 7, 7 * 5, or 5 + 7. In these types of problems, when you encounter multiple possible answers, the correct answer can often be narrowed down to the simplest answer. 35 and 7 are both factors of 5, but not of 7 * 5, so it can't be 7 * 5. 35 + 7 = 42, which is not a factor of 35.

The length of the map was already known and the width is unknown. We are required to find the width of the map.\nBy using simple area and length formulas, we know that:\n`A = length * width`\nwhere A = 10 square meters and length = 5 meters.\nFrom here, we can calculate the width by substituting A and length into the equation:\n`10 = 5 * width`\nTo solve for the width, we simply divide both sides by 5:\n`10 / 5 = width`\n`2 = width`\nTherefore, the width of the map is 2 meters.\n"}

The reason is that the length of each dimension is given in meters, so the area will also be in square meters. The other options are not products of the lengths.

{"question": "A book had a length of 5 inches and a total area of 50 square inches. How wide is the book?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "4 in", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "0.9\n\nExplanation: \nWe are given a book's total area is 50 square inches and its length is 5 inches. A book's area consists of its width and length. Therefore, we know that 5 inches times some number = 50 square inches. This means that the width of the book = 50 / 5 = 10 inches. However, this can not be the case because 10 inches times 5 inches would be 50 square inches, so the book must be narrower than 10 inches. The answer must be either 9 or 8 inches. However, because the total area is a multiple of 5, we know that 5 times some number must equal 50. The only numbers that multiply to 50 when we add up all the factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25. Because 1 and 2 are not in the original question, we know the answer must be 5, 10, or 25. The original problem did not state the book is a specific shape, so we can assume it is rectangular. Thus, we can eliminate the answer of 25 because no number times 5 is 25. 10 and 5 are"}

The checker works as an API and uses the reasoning of the reasoning checker to validate answers that are given by users. The reasoning checker is built by NLP techniques.\n\nThe checker works in two modes: (1) the default one that the users of the app can use, and (2) the one where the users can provide their own reasoning and answer. The first mode is more friendly for the users because it only requires them to provide the answer, the reasoning is inferred by the model and the system.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you just want to use the API and you don't need to modify any file, you can clone the repository using this command:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/smart-education/answer_checker.git\ncd answer_checker\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nIf you need to modify some part of the code, you may want to create a new virtual environment for your code. We strongly recommend to create a new environment because the one created during installation (using the requirements.txt file) is only used to run the API. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:\n```bash\npython -m"}

If the price of each pack is doubled, then the cost of 6 packs is twice as much as the cost of 3 packs. Since 2.97 and 3.87 are the closest multiples of 0.01, the cost of 3 packs is 3.87.

The information in the question suggests that \"1 dime\" is equivalent to 10 cents. Using this knowledge we can calculate the sum to be 28 cents.\n\nThere are many other ways to approach this problem.\nOne strategy is to use a unit conversion table.  This table allows you to calculate equivalent amounts. For example, \"3 pennies\" are equal to 3x1 = 3 cents. Adding this to the previous sum gives 31 cents.\nAnother strategy is to reason by analogy. If there are 2 quarters, then 2x25 = 50 cents. If there is 1 dime, then 1x10 = 10 cents.  If there are 3 pennies, then 3x1 = 3 cents. The sum is 63 cents, but this is more than what is needed. A strategy is to reduce this amount to a number that is smaller.  For example, 63 - 50 = 13. The strategy of subtraction is a useful tool when comparing amounts.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to break down the values of each coin by its numerical value."}

{"question": "Faye was placing her pencils into rows with eight pencils in each row. If she had thirty-two pencils,. how many rows could she make?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4 rows", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nReasoning: From these keywords, we can infer the question is about organizing pencil and the number of rows is also a parameter that need to be optimized. With these constraints, we can get the correct answer by following the two steps below:\n\n    Step 1: Find a group of objects such that when placed in a row of equal length, we get the number that is closest to the total number of objects.\n        The number of pencil in each row is 8, therefore we can group all 32 pencils into 4 rows of 8 pencils.\n    Step 2: Make the group as large as possible, that is, maximize the number of rows while keeping step 1 still holds.\n        After step 1, we already have 4 rows, which is the maximum.\n        \nOverall, this reasoning is convincing to me because I can follow the two steps very clearly. Moreover, since the numbers are not that large, I can perform the above reasoning easily without making many mistakes. Therefore, I think the answer is very likely to be correct and I am 95% confident about it.\n\nQ: How likely is this answer to be correct based on your initial judgment? \nPlease first show your reasoning concisely and then answer with the following"}

'11' means that Haley bought 11 shirts. '6' means that 6 of them were returned. '11 - 6' is subtraction, so we are subtracting 6 from 11. '5' is the result, and it is not equal to 11 - 6. We are going to use these keywords to help us reason about which answer is correct.\nWe can see that the possible answer has the keywords '11' and '6'. These keywords are related to the context of the question, so they are likely to be useful. The keyword '11 - 6' is also related to the context of the question, but it is not present in the possible answer. This means that the keyword '11 - 6' may be useful in reasoning about the possible answer, but it may not be as helpful as the other keywords.\nThe keyword '5' is present in the possible answer, but it is not related to the context of the question.

However, since the question asks for reasoning, we do have some evidence. First of all, we know from the title that we need to count the lives left, which could help us narrow down the answer choices, and we can also use common sense. Considering that the game is supposed to be difficult, we can conclude that the number of lives left is most likely to be less than half of the total number of lives. Thus, we can rule out 10. Moreover, because of the keywords \"hard level\", the number of lives left after this level may be relatively high, so we can rule out 1. This leaves us with 7 as the only possible answer. However, as the title says \"how likely\" instead of \"what is the correct answer\", the reasoning process is more important than the answer itself.\n```How confident are you in your reasoning?

If we let `w = Henry won a game, l = Henry lost a game, and d = a draw,`\n* Then the probability of Henry playing 14 games, assuming that we know that Henry won 2 games, lost 2 games and drew 10 games is: `P(Henry playing 14 games | Henry won 2 games, lost 2 games and drew 10 games)`. This can be re-written as `P(14 games | w=2, l=2, d=10) = 1, because if it is a conditional probability question and the probability is 1, then the condition is satisfied.\n* This question is essentially asking, `What is the probability of Henry playing 14 games, assuming that he played only these 14 games in total?` In that case, Henry must have won, lost, or drawn, and the number of games he played is 14. \n* Therefore, the answer is 1.\n* If you think the answer is 14, that is the number of games Henry played, but if you think the answer is the probability of Henry playing 14 games, then the"}

{"question": "An English teacher would like to divide 10 boys and 15 girls into groups, each with the same combination of boys and girls and nobody left out. What is the greatest number of groups that can be formed?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "15 groups", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation: In total, we have 10 boys and 15 girls. If the teacher wants to have the same number of boys and girls in each group, and nobody left out, then the number of boys and girls in each group has to be the same and a multiple of both 10 and 15. The greatest common divisor of 10 and 15 is 5. So we want to find all numbers between 1 and 10 that are divisible by 5, and all numbers between 1 and 15 that are divisible by 5.

P covers the distance 252/2 = 126 meters, and Q covers 198/2 = 99 meters. The time difference between the two athletes is 252/2 - 198/2 = 18 seconds.\n\nAs their speed differs, the time it takes for them to meet for the first time is not 18 seconds. The distance between them is decreasing at a decreasing rate, so the time until the first meeting is between 0 and 18 seconds. It can be proven by induction that the nth meeting happens after a time of 18/3^(n-1) seconds, with the n-th meeting being the last one. The last meeting happens after 18 seconds, so the two athletes meet for the first time after 18/3^0 = 18 seconds.\n\n# Answer:\n\nA: 60% (2.5 min)\n"}

The HCF is always the greatest common divisor. We need to find the number which is the greatest common divisor for both the numbers 2816 and 448. We will factorise both of these numbers in prime factors:\n\n448 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 = 28^3\n\n2816 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 7 = 28^5\n\nWe now find the HCF of 28 and 28^5, which is 28. Now since 28 = 2 x 2 x 7, we can deduce that the common factors of 2816 and 448 are 28, 4 and 2, so the smallest possible value of the cut pieces of the wires are 28 x 4 x 2 = 352 cm.\n\n"}

I have some reasoning for you here:\n\nGiven that Janice cut her ribbon into equal lengths of 2 m, we can infer that the length of the ribbon Janice was given is greater than 2 m. Otherwise, Janice could not cut the ribbon into equal lengths of 2 m. Therefore, the length of the ribbon given to Jasmine is equal to the length of the ribbon given to Janice minus 2 m.\n\nGiven that Jasmine cut her ribbon into equal lengths of 5 m, we can infer that the length of the ribbon Jasmine was given is a multiple of 5 m. Otherwise, Jasmine could not cut the ribbon into equal lengths of 5 m.\n\nTherefore, the length of the ribbon given to Jasmine is 2 m more than a multiple of 5 m. We can see that the length of the ribbon given to Jasmine is a multiple of 5 m because if the length of the ribbon given to Jasmine is not a multiple of 5 m, then the length of the ribbon given to Janice would not be a multiple of 5 m, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the length of the ribbon given to Jasmine is 2"}

For each of these, there are 7 ways to choose the third returning player and 22 remaining players to be in the last group. The total number of ways to choose these 8 groups is 8 × 7 × 22.

Therefore, the possible answer needs to be 7.\n- Considering the keywords \"2.5\" and \"7.5\", we can calculate that 7.5 is 3 times 2.5. Therefore, we know that 7.5 is a multiple of 2.5. The number 2.5 has to be an integer. This means that we need to consider all numbers 2.5 x n with n=1,2,3,4. This results in 5, 10, 15, 20. \n- Considering the keywords \"18\" and \"45\", we can calculate that 18 x 2 = 36. Therefore, the answer has to be a multiple of 18, so 2.5 x n = 18 x m with m an integer. This results in n=18 x 2 = 36/m. We therefore have to consider multiples of 36, and these are 36, 72, 108, 144. \n- We now have to find the intersection of"}

This means that there are 6 groups of 9 and 5 left over, or 31. 59= 6*9+5. 90= 9*10.

Therefore we need to add 5 to 54. 54+5=59, so 59-54=5. 59= 6*9+5. 90= 9*10. There are 6 groups of 9, so 6*9 = 54, and 90-54 = 36, so we have 5 left over (36-35=1, so this means 5 groups of 1, 36 total). Therefore we need to add 5 to 54. 54+5=59, so 59-54=5."}

How many cookies will each friend get?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22.125", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\n# Possible explanation:\nIf Chris is inviting 82 friends to a party, then he has to give each friend a cookie and a piece of candy. \nChris has 1804 cookies and 10 pieces of candy. This means that the ratio of cookies to candy is 1804 : 10. To find the number of cookies each friend will get, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of friends. \nWe can use the quotient and remainder of 1804 divided by 82 to find the answer: \n1804/82 = 22.125 and remainder = 8. \nThis means that each friend will get 22 cookies and there will be 8 cookies left over. To find the number of cookies each friend will get, we need to divide the number of cookies left over by the number of friends. \n1804/82 = 22 and remainder = 8. \n8/82 = 0.096 and 0.096 * 82 = 7.872. \nThis means that each friend will get 22 cookies and there will be 7.872 cookies left over.
