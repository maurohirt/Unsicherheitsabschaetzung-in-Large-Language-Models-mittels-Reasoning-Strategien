So, in order to find the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, we need to identify his paternal grandmother. Marie Clothilde was the daughter of Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy, who ruled as King of Sardinia from 1802 to 1821. He was the son of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, the king of Sardinia from 1796 to 1802. So, Charles Emmanuel IV was the paternal grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, 3rd Prince of Wagram. It is important to note that Charles Emmanuel IV was not the biological grandfather of Alexandre Berthier, as he was"}

{"question": "Who is the stepmother of James Stanley (Bishop)?", "correct answer": "Lady Margaret Beaufort", "llm answer": "Margaret Clifford is the stepmother of James Stanley (Bishop).", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation: James Stanley (Bishop) is the 7th Earl of Derby, as a child his father died and so the Earl of Derby title went to his uncle, the 6th Earl of Derby. James Stanley's mother died in childbirth so he was raised by his stepmother, the Dowager Lady Derby. The 6th Earl of Derby married Margaret Clifford, who was a member of the Clifford family, who lived in Skipton and whose family have a castle in Bellingham. Margaret Clifford had no children with the Earl, who died in 1585. It is likely the Earl died of grief as Margaret Clifford's brother Thomas was executed for treason in 1571. James Stanley was born in 1569, the same year as his uncle's execution, so it seems plausible James Stanley was raised by his uncle's wife, who must have been a stepmother. \n"}
