{"question": "28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "54", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\n```The question is equivalent to the following:\n     \"28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. Then, how many more children got on the bus than those that got off?\"\n\nThen the first step is to find how many children got on the bus altogether (both at the previous stop, and the current one). At the first stop, 28 got on the bus.  At the current stop, 82 got on the bus.  Then, there were 30 altogether.  So we need to figure out how many of those 82 got on at the current stop (since we need to find the difference between those children and the children that got off the bus).  We already know that there are 30 children altogether.  Therefore, there are 30-28=2 children that got on at the first stop.  Then, we need to find the difference between 82 (all of those that got on the bus) and 2 (the ones that got on at the first stop).  That means that 82-2=80 children got on the bus at the current stop"}

Therefore, Dean must have been 9 feet. 15 times the height of Dean would be 15 x 9 = 135. However, the depth of the water is only 13 feet. Since Ron stood in 13 feet, the water must have been deeper than 13 feet. So, 13 is the lower bound of the water's depth. Thus, the answer 255, which is 13 feet deeper than 13 feet, is not likely to be correct."}

{"question": "After Jessie started to go jogging everyday she lost 35 kilograms. She weighed 69 kilograms before beginning jogging. How much does she weigh now?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "34", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nExplanation: This is a very simple example. We know that Jessie gained 35 kg after starting to jog everyday. The amount of weight she lost from before to now (69 - 34 = 35 kg) is the amount of weight she lost from before starting jogging (69 kg) to after starting jogging. She can't possibly lose more weight. Also, she can't gain 35 kg in a few days from before to now (in contrast to Jessie gaining 35 kg after starting jogging).\n\nThis reasoning requires knowledge that 1) the before and now is in sequence of time, 2) weight can only increase/decrease over time (gain/lose weight), 3) weight doesn't increase/decrease by itself and require activity to do so (ex. not going to the gym -> weight gain), 4) weight can't increase/decrease arbitrarily over time (ex. Jessie can't gain 100kg after jogging 5 minutes)."}

Let's take a look at the keyword \"40 dollars\" first. It's Fred's money initially, so it's not the answer to the question. The question also mentions that \"Fred had 111 dollars\" initially, which means that the additional 4 dollars (40 - 111) must be Fred's money after washing cars, because Jason only earned 44 dollars from delivering newspapers. In other words, Fred must earn at least 44 dollars, so the answer can not be \"40 dollars\".\n\nNow let's move on to the keyword \"115 dollars\". This is Jason's money after delivering newspapers, which means that the additional 75 dollars (115 - 44) must be Jason's money after delivering newspapers.

Therefore, the question asks about the number of diet soda bottles. Then the given information is:\n17 bottles of soda (both regular and diet soda)\n9 regular bottles of soda\n29 apple\nWe know that the total number of bottles of regular soda is 9, and the total number of bottles of soda is 17. So, the total number of bottles of diet soda is 17 - 9 = 8.\n\nIn order to calculate the probability of the answer 8 to be correct, we can use the following formula:\nProbability = (number of possible combinations)/(total number of possibilities)\n\nFor the above question, there are 8 bottles of diet soda and the total number of bottles of soda is 17. So, the number of possible combinations is 8!/(8 - 2)! = 8*7*6*5*4*3*2 = 10080.\n\nSince there are 17 bottles of soda, the total number of possibilities is 17!/(17 - 2)! = 17*16*15*14*13*12*11*10"}

Given, there are 7 apples left on the tree after picking 2. Therefore total apples on the tree before picking 2, i.e. the number of apples at first, can be calculated by 7+2=9 apples. \n2. Out of these 9 apples, 6 are ripe and 3 are unripe. The number of apples on the tree after Rachel has picked 2 ripe apples are 7 apples. These 7 apples include 3 unripe apples which Rachel didn't pick. Therefore there were total 3+2=5 ripe apples on the tree at first. This gives the ratio of ripe apples to total apples as 5/9. \n3. It is given that the ratio of unripe apples to total apples is 3/9. Therefore the ratio of ripe apples to unripe apples is 5/3. This is also equal to (5/2)/(3/2), i.e. 5/2.

{"question": "Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 3 bird families living near the mountain. 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic while 2 bird families flew away further south for winter. How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "27", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation: ```The total number of bird families, both those that left and those that remained in the mountain, equals the total number of bird families that were there before winter. Therefore, 26 + 3 + 2 = 31 - 2 = 29 bird families remained in the mountain before winter. There are currently 3 bird families living near the mountain. Thus, 29 - 3 = 26 bird families left near the mountain for winter.```\n\nThe above reasoning shows that the answer is incorrect because:\n```The answer assumes that the 2 bird families that flew away further south for winter have completely disappeared from the mountain. However, considering the given keywords, we see that only 2 bird families flew away, not 3. Thus, it is incorrect to assume that the 2 bird families that flew away have disappeared from the mountain. Therefore, the reasoning is not correct and the answer is incorrect.```\n"}

How many more chairs than tables do they have?", "correct answer": 117.0, "llm answer": "123", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\nReasoning:\n```The key to answer this question is that chairs is proportional to the number of tables. Since there are 14 chairs in each set of table, and there are 9 sets of tables, therefore there are 14 * 9 = 126 chairs. However, since there are 9 sets of tables, so the total number of tables is 9. Therefore, the answer should be 126 - 9 = 117.```\nConfidence: 10%\nReasoning:\n```If there are 14 chairs for each set of table, there will be 14 chairs for each of 9 sets of tables, that is 14 times 9, which is 126. But 9 is 9 times 9. Thus, 9 times the answer should be 126, which is 14 times 9. The answer is 14.```\nConfidence: 30%\nReasoning:\n```There are 9 tables, each with 14 chairs.

This question just asked the difference of \"caked sold\" and \"caked bought\". And the keyword \"bought\" is mentioned 3 times in the question, indicating this answer is highly likely to be correct.\n# Comments\nI am a bit confused by your reasoning here. I think there are three numbers involved, i.e., 8, 139 and 145. Why did you include \"147 cakes\"? How do you determine that the answer is 2?\nI am curious about how you think about this problem in general. You are thinking about the keywords and using them to reason about the answer. But sometimes the keywords are not clear, for example, when it is not a single word (such as \"caked sold\") but a whole sentence like \"Baker sold 145 cakes\". In this case, the keyword \"Baker\" is mentioned twice in the question but the keyword \"sold\" is only mentioned once. How do you determine the keywords in this case? Also, when the keywords are determined, how do you determine their weights? For example, \"Baker\" is mentioned twice but \"sold\" is mentioned"}

Using this information, we can create a table to keep track of the information:\n\nNumber of Days | Number of Sacks Harvested\n---------------|---------------------------\n1               | 18\n2               | 36\n3               | 54\n\nThis table shows us that it took 3 days to harvest the 54 sacks of oranges.\n\nOverall, this problem requires us to use simple addition and multiplication to solve. It is important to make sure that all of the information is accounted for in the solution and that all of the operations are done correctly."}

Since I have the keywords given in the question, I thought of how the question is asking me to find out how many invitations Carol needs to buy to invite her 9 friends to a birthday party. And I thought of what are the things I already know from the keywords in the question.\nSo I first tried to count how many invitations in each package that I can find. I realized that each package has 3 invitations inside. So I have to count how many invitations in total I need to invite my 9 friends to the birthday party.\nSince I already know the information that there is 2 packs and each pack has 3 invitations, I multiply 2 and 3 to get 6 invitations. So, if I already invite 6 invitations, there will still be 3 invitations left, but I only need to invite 9 friends. So I need 3 invitations more to invite my friends. This means that I need to buy 1 package more.\n"}

Ron stands at 12 feet, which means he is 1 foot from the water. Because the water is 5 times his height, he is 5 feet from the water. He is already 1 foot above the water, so he is 4 feet above the water. That means Dean must be at least 4 feet below the water, so the answer is 4.

Since erasers are kept safe, we have 66 erasers to begin with and the number is unchanged. Therefore, the number of crayons lost or given away is exactly the number of crayons Paul had before the end of the year. \n\nWe can further see that 521 is much more than 154, therefore the 521 must have been reduced to 154. This means that the number of crayons lost or given away is 367.\n\nThere is an alternative solution path as well: if we know that the keywords are all correct and non-redundant, we can make the following observation:\n\n`367 - 154 = 213 = 521 -?`\n\nTherefore, the unknown number must be 308.\n\nIn any case, we can answer with confidence that the correct answer must be 367, i.e., `Confidence: 100%`\n\n\n"}

The first thing I noticed was that Danny collected 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. He then collected 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers at home. This means he has a total of 37 bottle caps and 105 wrappers. If we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers, we get 68.\n\nNow, let's consider the additional information given. The question mentions that Danny found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. If we add this information to our original calculation, we get 27 + 10 = 37 and 43 + 62 = 105. This gives us the same result as before, which is 68.\n\nOverall, I think the answer is 68 because it makes sense given the information provided. Danny found more wrappers than bottle caps at the park, and he found more bottle caps than wrappers at home. This suggests that he has more wrappers than bottle caps overall.\n\nThe answer seems to be reasonable, and I have a confidence of 80% that it is correct."}

How many sweet cookies did Paco have left?", "correct answer": 19.0, "llm answer": "Paco had 19 sweet cookies left.", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n\nExplanation:\nTo correctly answer this question, we need to be able to calculate a percentage from 2 numbers. We start with the given information:\n\nPaco had 97 salty cookies and 34 sweet cookies.\nHe ate 15 sweet cookies and 56 salty cookies.\nThe first information tells us the total amount of cookies Paco has, and the second tells us how many he ate.\nThe goal is to find out how many sweet cookies Paco has left. To do this, we subtract the amount of cookies he ate from the total amount he has. This gives us the amount of cookies he has left. We then find the amount of sweet cookies Paco has left by subtracting the amount of sweet cookies he ate from the total amount of sweet cookies he had. This gives us the amount of sweet cookies Paco has left.\nSo, 34 - 15 = 19. Paco has 19 sweet cookies left."}

However, the question said that Lewis needs to pay $49 in rent weekly. In a year, there are 52 weeks, so Lewis' rent cost for the year is 49x52 = 2548. The annual income of Lewis after deducting his rent cost is 94389 - 2548 = 81841. Thus the correct answer is $81841.```"}

During the first round of selection, I use the keywords as exact phrases and only include those answer choices that include these phrases. In this way, we can immediately filter out incorrect choices that do not contain any of the phrases. Then we can start using the keywords to do reasoning and inference. I only reason with the keywords when we can get information to make inferences.\nIn the above problem, since we do not know how many kids are in Lawrence county, we can't know whether the phrase `go to camp` includes all kids in Lawrence county or just the kids that go to the camp. However, we know that `stay home` is only used to describe the kids from Lawrence county. So if the answer `stay home` appears, it cannot be correct because we know that `stay home` is not used to describe the kids from outside Lawrence county. Therefore, choice `stay home` can be ruled out immediately.\nAfter we rule out `stay home`, the only possible answer is `424911 kids`, which is the sum of the numbers of kids in Lawrence county and the other kids, which is the number of kids in total.\n\nI also do some further analysis and"}

About how many kids are in Lawrence county?", "correct answer": 1363293.0, "llm answer": "1.4", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30.0%\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we need to consider the context of the passage and the keywords provided. The passage tells us that there are two types of kids in Lawrence county, those who stay home during the summer break and those who go to camp. We are given the number of kids in each group. To find the total number of kids in Lawrence county, we need to add the number of kids who stay home and the number of kids who go to camp.\nUsing the keywords, we can see that the number of kids who stay home is 907611, and the number of kids who go to camp is 455682. To add these numbers, we can use the Commutative Property of Addition, which states that the order in which we add numbers does not matter. We can rearrange the numbers to be 907611 + 455682, and then add them together to get 1363293.\nTherefore, the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 1363293, and the confidence in this answer is 30%. This is because the keywords provided are the only information given to us, and we are only able to estimate the total number of kids based on the information provided."}

After cutting off some hair, her hair was reduced to 13 inches in length. The question is, how much hair did Robin cut off to reduce her hair from 17 inches to 13 inches?\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the information given in the question. We know that Robin's hair was initially 17 inches long and after cutting off some hair, it was reduced to 13 inches. Therefore, the difference between Robin's initial hair length and her new hair length is 17-13=4 inches.\nThis means that Robin cut off 4 inches of her hair to reduce it from 17 inches to 13 inches.

Therefore, the sum of two integers must be an integer, too. So it is not possible to divide 33 by 11 to get the possible answer as an integer. If we look at the possible answer 3 as a sum of two integer cookies, 1 bag of cookies must have 3 + 0 = 3 cookies. Another bag has 11 - 3 = 8 cookies. Thus, we have 3 + 8 = 11 cookies. However, it is not possible that two different bags of cookies have 3 cookies, because the total number of cookies would be 3 + 3 = 6 which is less than the given 33 cookies. Thus, the given answer is not correct. \nAnother reason that the answer is not correct is based on the keywords 'each bag has 11 cookies'. If the answer is correct, then the first bag of cookies has 3 cookies, and the second bag of cookies has 11 - 3 = 8 cookies.

How big is each group of bananas?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "1462.58", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Reasoning: I multiply 7 to 203 and then divide 7 to 95 and get 1421 divided by 95, so the answer is 1421/95= 14.921 and round it to 15. Also, the keywords say 7 groups, so I take 203 divided by 7, and get 29. And 1421 is very close to 29 so 1421-29= 1421-29= 1392. So 1392/95= 14.63 which is even closer to 29 than 15 and 15-14.63= 0.37. Also, the keywords are about groups so I try to put them together. 7*29=203 and 95*0.66=63 so it makes sense that bananas are 7 times bigger than oranges. So the answer is (7*0.66)/95 and it is 0.37 which is close to 15 so the answer is 15. It is a round answer because we divide 7*0.66 by 95. This is the answer I believe is most correct.```\n"}

So we do not have a starting point. We do not have a known point.\nThe solution is still 17, but it is not clear if it is correct.

How many more movies do you still have to watch?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: We can read 19 of the books which means we read 4/4 books and watched 7 movies which means we watch 7/17 movies. Now, considering 'books' and'movies' are independent, there are 19 possibilities we can read and 17 possibilities we can watch. Hence, there is 19x17 = 319 total possibilities of combinations of reading books and watching movies. Since we can read 19 books, the probability of reading a book is 19/319 = 6%. Since we watch 7 movies, the probability of watching a movie is 7/319 = 2%. Since reading a book and watching a movie are independent, the probability of reading 19 books and watching 7 movies is 6%*2% = 0.012% which means the probability of us reading 19 books and not watching 7 movies is 99.988%.

Also, there are more water bottles than soda bottles (and she drank more soda than water), so it seems likely that she will not have enough water to last through the time it took her to finish all the soda bottles. There were 13 soda bottles, and she drank 4 water bottles and 87 soda bottles a day.

That is, the difference between 136 and 109 should be equal to 27. This relation is only valid for subtraction, because 109 < 136. Subtraction is the only arithmetic operation that will give us a positive difference between two values. We therefore conclude that Paul sold 109 books.\n- 109 books is the only possible answer because we know that he sold a number of books, and therefore the number of books sold cannot be negative (as it is not possible to sell a negative number of books).\n"}

We can get this by simply taking the middle number from the answer options. Then we can also reason that if Nell has 252 cards left and gave away some cards to Jeff, it must be fewer than that.\n"}

This is because we are dealing with a mathematical problem, it could be easy to determine the answer by doing some simple math. The keyword ```594``` indicates the total number of pages, ```607``` indicates the total number of days. The keyword ```594/607``` indicates the number of pages per day, which is very close to ```1```, which makes sense because in general, people will read one page per day. The keyword ```594/3``` indicates the number of pages per chapter, which is ```198```. So, the answer is ```198```.\n"}

How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?\n>\n> Possible Answer: 123\n\nThe question asks for the number of baseball cards minus the number of Ace cards. \nThe difference in the number of cards between Nell's collection before giving some to Jeff and her collection after giving some to Jeff must be the number of cards she gave to Jeff.\nThe difference is 438 - 178 - 55 = 205, therefore 205 baseball cards were given to Jeff.\nBecause there were originally 438 baseball cards and 205 baseball cards were given to Jeff, Nell has 233 baseball cards after giving some to Jeff.\nSince she also has 55 Ace cards, she must have given 18 - 55 = -37 Ace cards to Jeff. \nTherefore, the number of baseball cards minus the number of Ace cards is 233 - 55 = 178.\n\n### Confidence:\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 123 to be correct, not the one you think correct,"}

The average number of visitors within the last 327 days is 406/327 = 1.23. Similarly, since 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace today, we can find the average number of visitors in the last 1 day. The average number of visitors in the last 1 day is 132/1 = 132. Therefore, to estimate the number of visitors on the previous day, we need to find the number of visitors such that it is an average of the last 1 day and the last 327 days.
