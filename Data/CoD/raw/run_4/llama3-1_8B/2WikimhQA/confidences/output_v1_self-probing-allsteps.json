According to the article, Andhra Pradesh was struggling to ramp up the number of COVID-19 tests due to a paucity of laboratory equipment and manpower at the state-run regional diagnostic labs. Private labs too were struggling because of the shortage of testing kits. Hyperlocal labs emerged as a solution to this problem. These are small labs that have a capacity to conduct at least 100 tests a day and are located close to the districts where they operate. They are more cost-effective and convenient than regional diagnostic labs. They also take much less time to report the test results.```"}

The first thing I did was check who Nicomedes III was related to and found that he was the son of Ariarathes VI, who was the son of Ariarathes V (in that order) who is the brother of Ariarathes IV. As a result, Nysa is the great-granddaughter of Ariarathes IV. Ariarathes IV had a brother named Orophernes and a daughter named Athenais, and they're both mentioned in 1Maccabees 14:24 so I decided to check who their children were to see if there was any possible connection with Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia (who is mentioned in the Bible once in 2Maccabees 5:1). Ariarathes V, the father of Ariarathes VI, had a brother named Ariarathes III (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariarathes_IV_of_Cappadocia and http://"}

So, considering these reasoning steps, we have that Katherine's stepdaughter is the daughter of someone and Katherine's daughter is the stepdaughter of someone. From these two sentences, we know that someone's daughter is also someone's stepdaughter, which means that someone is both the mother and the stepmother of Katherine.

This narrows down the possible answer choices to Artavasdes Iii Of Armenia and Tigranes Iv Of Armenia. However, we also know that Artavasdes Iii Of Armenia was born in 30 BCE and Khosrov Iii The Small was born in 330, which means that Artavasdes Iii Of Armenia would have been over 300 years old when Khosrov Iii The Small was born.
