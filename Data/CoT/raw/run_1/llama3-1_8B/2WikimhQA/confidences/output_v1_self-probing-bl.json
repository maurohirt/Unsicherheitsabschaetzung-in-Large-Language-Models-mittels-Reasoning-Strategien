It was built between 1819 and 1834 to designs by the noted architect Thomas Hopper for Archibald Acheson, 4th Earl of Gosford. Hopper and the 4th Earl had a close personal relationship; the 4th Earl referred to Hopper as \"My Dear Uncle\", although they were not actually related.\nHopper based his design on the Italian Renaissance villa of Palazzo Te by the Milanese architect Girolamo della Robbia. Acheson commissioned Hopper to build a home for himself in a Gothic style, but was so taken with Hopper's designs for the castle that he decided to build a castle in Hopper's preferred Italian Renaissance style.\nThe castle was built in a mix of Gothic, Romanesque, and Renaissance styles. The interior decoration is notable for a collection of portraits, including a painting by Joshua Reynolds of the 4th Earl's father, the 3rd Earl of Gosford.\n\nGosford Castle served as a police station in the 1920s and 1930s.

The Duke of Gordon was the second Duke, because the title is given to his grandfather Charles Gordon. We know this because the father of Catherine Maria Gordon was Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, whose father was George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon, and his father was George Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon. We then look at the first Duke of Gordon, Charles Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon. We see that the 4th Duke's father's mother was Elizabeth Montgomerie. Then, we see that the 1st Duke of Gordon's wife was Elizabeth Montgomerie. Therefore, it seems to be a safe bet that the 1st Duke of Gordon is the paternal grandfather of Caroline's mother.\n\nNote by Steven Zheng\n5 years, 6 months ago\n\nMarkdownAppears as\n*italics* or _italics_ italics\n**bold** or __bold__ bold\n- bul"}

It is said that the Sikh Misls were formed in 1708, which was the same year when the 10th Guru Gobind Singh, died. The Sikh Misls came to an end with the coming of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the year 1799, who unified the Sikhs into one kingdom, and became the Maharaja of Punjab.

If you know a little bit of history, you might know that the Stirlings have been Earls of Buchan since the 14th century (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Buchan). Therefore Jean Louise Stuart would be the current earl. Her son, Lord Patrick Crichton-Stuart, would be the heir presumptive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_presumptive).

His name means \"Horus, son of Ra, born of the strong\". He was the third son of the king Pinudjem I and his wife Duathathor-Henuttawy.\nOsorkon III was the penultimate ruler of the 22nd Dynasty of Egypt.

This arrangement lasted until 785 BC, when Osorkon finally deposed and killed his brother, and became sole ruler of the Theban kingdom, although his sister's son, Iuput, was appointed High Priest of Amun, and probably co-regent."}

His ancestor, John of Gaunt, was the son of Edward III. His mother, Elizabeth of York, was the daughter of Edward IV. Henry was born in Wales to Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond, a descendant of the Lancastrian nobility, and Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, a Welsh courtier. His birth, as well as that of his elder brother, were both accompanied by portents, as was his father's coronation, which was held in Westminster Abbey in London. The Tudor family were distant relatives of the royal House of Lancaster and thus had potential hereditary claims to the English throne through John of Gaunt, but Henry's succession was unlikely as there were many senior heirs in the line of descent. In 1485, Henry Tudor reversed his fortunes by landing in Wales instead of England, winning the support of Margaret Beaufort and her powerful Lancastrin relatives; and defeating Richard III in the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was subsequently crowned King of England. The victory against Richard at the Battle of Bosworth, coupled with the death of Richard III"}

For instance, if Cao Li’s father is Yang Zhao, then he would inherit the surname Yang (杨). It follows that Cao Li’s paternal grandfather would have the same surname as his father.

The only option which is consistent with this logic is option (B) Yang Zhao.\n\nQ: How do you know that the reasoning above is correct?\nReasoning: I think the reasoning is correct because when the name of someone’s father is given, the name of their grandfather can be inferred through the given information that the surname is passed down from the father.

I am less certain of Acfred being his father, but I believe that it is very likely. I believe it is much less likely that Emma was his daughter. Acfred was the son of William I Taillefer, Count of Toulouse, but was born sometime before 927. Emma was born in 1090. A possible solution is that Acfred married a daughter of William Taillefer, but William Taillefer did not have any daughters. I am not aware of any other children of William Taillefer besides Acfred. If Emma was Acfred's daughter, he must have had a daughter late in life, possibly after he had been exiled to his estates in 950. I do not believe this is likely. If Acfred was his father, it could have been that his daughter married a son of Acfred. However, Acfred died in 957. The son of Emma of Provence who I believe to be Acfred I of Carcassonne was born in 956, which is well after Acfred's death. I am unsure of the accuracy of the dates, but"}

The probability of Mary being Charles I's paternal grandmother, the first event, is $0.3$. The probability of Mary being the paternal grandmother of anyone among the living, the second event, is the number of her descendants that are currently alive divided by the total number of descendants. According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendants_of_Mary,_Queen_of_Scots), Mary has about 9000 living descendants, about $80\\%$ of which are male and about $20\\%$ female, about $10\\%$ of which have a descendant that currently lives in England. The percentage of living people that are of royal birth is unknown, however, it is known that only those people that are not of royal birth can have a descendant of royal birth, therefore, this probability is certainly greater than $0$. Assuming $0.1$ for the sake of argument, the probability of Charles I being related to Mary in any way is $0.9$. The probability of Charles I being Mary's paternal grandmother is $0.9\\times 0.3 = 0.27$. The probability of Charles I being the son of someone that"}

The question asks for the identity of the father of Maria, who is described as \"a famous crusader of the Middle Ages\" and \"one of the greatest warriors of his time\". Based on the information provided, it is likely that William III, Count of Hainault, is the father of Maria.\nFirstly, William III was indeed a crusader and a great warrior of his time. He fought in the Second Crusade and was known for his military skills and leadership. Secondly, William III was also a nobleman, and it is likely that he would have been able to afford a noble daughter, such as Maria. Thirdly, Maria was born in Galicia, which was under the rule of the Kingdom of León at the time. William III's mother, Matilda, was the daughter of the King of England, which means that he was likely to have had connections with the royal families of Europe.\nOn the other hand, there is no information provided about the other potential candidates for Maria's father, such as the King of León or the Duke of"}

She has spent the last year in prison for treasonous acts, and you alone, as her one and only heir, can claim the dukedom to which she is entitled. She has sent me here in the middle of the night to find you and to give you the good news. You are, my dear young lady, Catherine Fitzcharles' only heir.\nSo in order to be her paternal grandmother, she must have given birth to Catherine's father. She must have been married to someone who Catherine's father married and who gave birth to Catherine. So if she is married to someone, then the only way for that to occur is that her husband is either Catherine's mother's brother, Catherine's mother's father, Catherine's mother's uncle, Catherine's mother's maternal uncle or Catherine's mother's paternal uncle.\nSo Barbara Villiers, as the wife of Charles II, could be either Catherine's mother's paternal uncle or Catherine's mother's paternal grandmother.

However, Gatterer had not done any primary research and there is no other evidence to suggest that he was the father of Baldwin I. I think it is much more likely that he was the husband of Euphemia. \nThe article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_I_of_Hungary, in its current state of revision, is wrong, as it is using Gatterer's conclusion without sufficient justification.

However, from the text of the passage it can be inferred that his mother was \"born into a well-established family,\" which suggests that she had access to resources and connections that would have allowed her to pursue higher education. This would also mean that she had the opportunity to attend a school where she could study the natural sciences and possibly even work with Paus' father. Additionally, given the fact that Paus' father was a professor of physics at an American university, it is possible that his mother was also educated in the sciences and may have had a career in academia as well. All things considered, it is most likely that Nikolai Paus' mother was born into a family with means and connections that enabled her to pursue a career in academia.\n```"}

The term also refers to the spouse of one's parents-in-law. The term is also used for the spouses of one's in-laws. For example, a spouse's brother or sister-in-law would be a sibling-in-law.\n\nThe sibling-in-law of a prince is a prince or princess. Since the sibling-in-law of a king is a prince or princess, the sibling-in-law of a king's son is also a prince or princess.\n\nFavila of Asturias was the first King of Asturias from 739 to 739, succeeding Alfonso I in the Asturian throne. He was also Count of Cangas, the first count of Galicia. His parents were Count Fafila, son of the Visigoth King Witiza, and Urraca of Asturias, daughter of King Fafila of Asturias.\n\nRiquierio is one of the four main antagonists of the anime series Black Clover.

The second reason for the confidence is that if you know a little about Irish history (if not, here's a very good read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Dukes_of_Leinster#17th_Century ), you know that the FitzWilliam family has been one of the most prominent families in Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries. \n\nIn fact, there's even a chapter dedicated to them in that Wikipedia article (the Rise of the Dukes of Leinster in 17th century).
