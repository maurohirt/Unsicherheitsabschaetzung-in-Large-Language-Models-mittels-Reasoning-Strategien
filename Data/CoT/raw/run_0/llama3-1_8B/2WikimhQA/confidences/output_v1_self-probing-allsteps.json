In addition, Hugh of Champagne is the son of Baldwin V, Count of Chartres, while Baldwin I of Jerusalem is also Baldwin V, Latin Emperor.

The question asks about Edward Howard's grandfather, while the answer refers to the paternal grandfather. This difference is important because a son may have multiple grandfathers (one from his mother and one from his father), while a father usually only has one grandfather.\nTo find the answer, we start by looking at the facts given in the question and answer. Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle was the son of Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle and his wife, Catherine de Courcy. We can then use the reasoning steps to find Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk as the father of Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle, making him the paternal grandfather of Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle.\nHowever, we still need to consider the fact that Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk is also the paternal grandfather of Edward Howard, 2nd Earl of Carlisle.

Since this is the case, I think that the answer is correct.\nIn the following video, the narrator discusses how Baron Johann Jakob von Heiss's full name is Baron Johann Jakob von Heiss, Helfenstein.

The father-in-law can either be Amadeus V, Amadeus VI, or even Amadeus VII, who is also the son of Amadeus V, and the grandson of Amadeus VI. If Bertha's husband has two fathers, she is not sure which one is her father-in-law.\nThe reasoning itself is a little bit weak in that it only uses one way to determine the answer and doesn't have additional evidence to back up the reasoning. We cannot determine whether the answer is correct or not because we cannot distinguish the likelihood that the father-in-law is the paternal or maternal grandfather, or the grandfather of Amadeus VI. But since Bertha's husband has only one father, the answer is likely to be correct.

The youngest son of Malcolm III and Margaret of Wessex, David spent most of his childhood in Scotland, but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093. Perhaps the most successful of Scotland's early kings, David's long reign of 29 years was long enough to oversee the development in which Scotland had an \"established Church\", and to mark the emergence of a \"Kingdom of the Scots\". His younger brothers, Edgar and Alexander, were consecutively kings, while his daughter, Matilda, was queen-consort of England, making David the maternal grandfather of the only English king to rule from Scotland, King Edgar Atheling. David succeeded his elder brother, Alexander I, after a contested election. In 1124, he became king in a victory overshadowed by the death of Alexander's widow. From then on he ruled for thirty years as one of Scotland's most successful kings. In 1136, David invaded and captured the Kingdom of Strathclyde, the last part of Britain yet to be converted to Christianity. His greatest achievement was the colonisation"}

As I mentioned above, that is probably the only reason for Irene to be the paternal grandmother of Alexander. I don't think the reasoning works in reverse; I don't think you can say that Irene Komnene is the paternal grandmother of Alexander, so she was the first wife of Alexios I Gidos. It makes more sense to say that Irene was Alexios I Gidos' first wife, and the mother of Alexios II Gidos, and so the grandmother of Alexander.\nI found two websites which mention Irene as Alexios I Gidos' first wife.

Then I looked at each reasoning step, and for each reasoning step I figured out whether the additional information made the answer more or less likely. In this case, because Pedro III of Portugal is the father of João VI of Portugal, which is the father of Pedro II of Portugal, which is the father of Infanta Maria Francisca of Braganza, I concluded that the answer is more likely to be correct, since the additional information adds more support to the answer being correct. Therefore, my confidence was 90%.\nThis method of answering this question is based on the idea that the more supporting reasons we have, the more likely the answer is to be correct. By breaking down each reasoning step, we can identify which ones are supported by the additional information, and which ones are not. This allows us to make a more informed guess at the answer and increase our confidence in the final answer.\nQ: Assuming you only know the additional information, how likely is the answer to be correct?

While Gertrude of Brunswick-Luneburg, Countess of Stade is the correct spouse for William I, Count of Stade, it may not be the correct reason for him to be the paternal grandfather of Beatrice I, Abbess Of Quedlinburg. In which case, we might need more reasoning to make sure we have the correct spouse to give the correct answer. On the other hand, there are two good reasons to think the answer could be correct. One is, William I, Count of Stade is the father of Henry I, Count of Stade, Beatrice I, Abbess Of Quedlinburg's father.

We may have some doubts about it as the name of his father is not known for certain, but the probability of this to be false is low. If this is correct, then we can deduce the name of Faílbe's father from the information in Step 2. Then we have some doubts about Step 2 as well. This is because the name of his son Faílbe Flaind is also not certain. We need to consult some more information to help us decide the correct name. As the step contains two names, we have to evaluate the probability for each name. So we will take the worst case, that is the probability for Faílbe Flaind to be the correct name is 50%. We can use the following formula to calculate the probability of Colgú Mac Faílbe Flaind to be correct:\n$$ P = P_0 \\cdot P_1 \\cdot P_2 $$\n\\(P_0\\) is the probability of the source in Step 1 to be correct, \\(P_1\\) is the probability of Faílbe Flaind to be correct, \\("}

I have considered it from a few different angles and have found that there are many steps that I could have taken, leading me to the answer. I have outlined the reasoning below.\nWe know that Adriana's mother was Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, so the first thing I did was to search for Adriana's maternal grandparents. I found that Amalia of Solms-Braunfels was the daughter of Johann Georg I, Count of Solms-Braunfels, and his wife, Margarete of Schonburg-Glauchau.\nI then looked at Amalia's mother and father and found that Margarete was the daughter of Albert IV of Schonburg-Glauchau, and Elisabeth of Nassau-Siegen. I then looked at Albert's mother and found that Elisabeth of Nassau-Siegen was the daughter of Johann VI of Nassau-Dillenburg and Elisabeth of Leuchtenberg. Johann VI was the father of William the Silent.\nThis tells us that the maternal grandfather of Adriana is Johann Georg I, Count of Solms-Braunfels, and his father is Johann VI of Nassau-D"}

There was another Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford, born around 1222. So he could not be the father of Maud's father, who was born around 1260.\nSince there were two Richard de Clares born in the same century, it is safe to assume they were not brothers or cousins. Therefore the father of Gilbert de Clare, and the father of Maud de Clare, was Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester.\nRichard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford died before 1246, and Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester died in 1262. Therefore, both were born before Gilbert's birth.\nThe above answers the question by excluding the other possible answers.\nAnother way to get to the answer is by comparing the list of all earls of Gloucester:\nEarls of Gloucester\nRobert Fitzhamon, 1088-1107\nRoger Fitzroy, 1107-1139\nWilliam Fitzro"}
