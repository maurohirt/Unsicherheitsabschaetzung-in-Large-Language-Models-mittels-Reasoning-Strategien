I chose 22 because I have an image of two numbers that are separated by 10, and the first number is 30, so the second number is 50. This is a type of distractor called ‘an image.’  The answer would be 31+22=53.\nReasoning:\nThe first key word, 53 presents, is the answer itself. However, it does not reveal whether the answer is Ethan's number or Alissa's number. Thus, we need to reason about Ethan's number. With the second key word, 31 presents, we can reason that Ethan has 31 presents and Alissa has 31+22 presents (the other key word, 22, represents the difference between Ethan and Alissa's number of presents). Since the question asks about Alissa's number of presents, the answer must be 31+22 presents = 53 presents. Thus, I chose 53.\nReasoning:\nThe answer is 53. The second and third keywords “22” and “31” together, provide a clue for the final answer.\nReasoning:\nThe answer is"}

The probability of the second pull depends on the first pull.\nHowever, in the question, it does not state the stickers are in one pile or independent events.\nIn this problem, it states that Cindy uses 23 stickers and buy 45 more stickers, so the stickers are not independent events. The second event (buy 45 more stickers) depends on the first event (use 23 stickers). So, Cindy uses 23 stickers and buy 45 more stickers, the probability that Cindy has 127 stickers is 0.\nIn conclusion, I agree with the provided answer of 127, but I cannot agree with the reasoning of Cindy having 127 stickers after she uses 23 stickers and buys 45 more stickers."}

How many more apples does Kelly need to pick to have 105 apples altogether?", "correct answer": 49.0, "llm answer": "24.5", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation: You need more information to determine this. You need to know how Kelly picks apples, i.e. whether each apple that Kelly picks adds one to the count of apples she has, or whether the addition of each apple to her count is based on some other logic. Also, if Kelly had 56 apples to begin with, you need to know whether it is possible for her to have 105 apples altogether, or whether there are some additional constraints on the amount of apples she can have altogether.\n\nThe correct answer: Kelly had 54 apples to begin with, and each time she picks an apple, the number of apples she has increases by 1, so after she picks 51 apples, she has a total of 105 apples altogether. The answer to the question in this case is 24.5.\nConfidence: 100%"}

That's to say, there are ```no pencils``` left for Josh if ```all the 142 pencils``` are taken. Therefore, ```31 pencils``` should be taken from the total of ```142 pencils```. In that case, ```111 pencils``` is left for Josh.\n\n```Inference: no pencils is taken away from the initial total if all the pencils are taken away.```\n\nIf we take the other end ```all the 142 pencils``` away from Josh, the statement ```He gave 31 pencils to Dorothy``` implies that Dorothy would have all the pencils, which is 142 pencils.

How many more seashells does she need to find to have 25 seashells in her collection?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nSolution:\n```Let's define a new variable `x` as the number of seashells that Megan needs to find, so that she has 25 seashells in her collection. We know that she has 19 seashells right now. We can use this variable to set up an equation, Megan has 25 seashells after finding `x` seashells, so 25 = 19 + `x`. This can be solved by subtracting 19 from both sides, 25 - 19 = `x`, and we find `x = 6`. Therefore, Megan needs to find 6 more seashells in order to have 25 seashells in her collection.```\n\n\n### This is the original question, please DO NOT edit it:\n```What's the right answer of the following question: Megan has 19 seashells.

Inductive reasoning takes that general idea and finds evidence for it in order to confirm the idea. Inductive reasoning is used in the process of formulating a hypothesis. A hypothesis is based on inductive reasoning and is then tested through the process of deductive reasoning. For example, if a student notices that their neighbor always wears a necklace with a pendant and that their neighbor's cat is always around them, the student might come up with a general idea that a cat and a necklace with a pendant could be a good thing to wear to school. The next step would be for the student to try wearing the necklace and cat to school and see if it works for them. Inductive reasoning led to the student trying the necklace and cat to school, and deductive reasoning led to the student testing the necklace and cat to see if it is beneficial.```"}

{"question": "After they vacation, they figured out that the farm was divided into 5 sections and each section has a land area of 60 acres. What is the total area of the farm?", "correct answer": 300.0, "llm answer": "121.5 hectares", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: There are two methods to solve this problem. The first method is to compute the number of acres per section using 60 acres divided by 5 sections, which equals 12 acres per section. Since there are five sections, the total number of acres in the farm is 5 times 12 acres, which equals 60 acres. To convert acres to hectares, multiply the number of acres by 0.405. Since 60 acres multiplied by 0.405 equals 24.3 hectares, the total area of the farm is 24.3 hectares.\nThe second method is to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Since each section has a width of 60 acres and a length of 1 acre, the area of each section is 60 acres times 1 acre, which equals 60 square acres. Since there are five sections, the total area of the farm is 5 times 60 square acres, which equals 300 square acres. To convert acres to hectares, multiply the number of square acres by 0.405. Since 300 square acres multiplied by 0.405 equals 121.5 hectares, the total area of the farm is 121.5 hectares.\n"}

The first one is by thinking the number of magazines and number of boxes simultaneously and solve it algebraically (see below). This approach is good because it can be used for more complex problems (e.g., the number of boxes is not fixed, but variable) by changing only one variable in the equation.\nThe second way is by dividing the number of magazines by the number of boxes, and see if the result is integer, which can give a very rough estimate for the number of boxes. This approach can only be used in simpler problems. The advantage is that it is easier and more intuitive, and requires less thinking, which is why we use this approach for solving problems in this app.\nFor this particular problem, it's easy to see that the number of boxes is smaller than 63/9=7. Thus the answer cannot be 8. And since there are only 4 answers, it is easy to check by trying each one of them. The above confidence is from checking the answer of 7.\nFor the above method, let n be the number of boxes and m be the number of magazines.\nThen n\\*9=m\nso n=\\frac{m}{9}\nSince n"}

The second keyword is the average number of croissants each guest would get if Cristina plans to serve them equally, which is 2.42. The third keyword is the number of croissants each guest would get if they all get the same number of croissants, which is 3.\n#### The Reasoning:\nThe total number of croissants is 17, and the average number of croissants each guest would get if Cristina plans to serve them equally is 2.42. This means that the total number of croissants should be evenly divisible by the average number of croissants each guest would get. Since 17 is not evenly divisible by 2.42, this means that Cristina cannot serve all of her guests the same number of croissants.\nThe number of croissants each guest would get if they all get the same number of croissants is 3. This means that each guest would get 3 croissants, and there would be 1 croissant left over. Since"}

For every single snowman drawing, there are 4 copies. However, we do not know whether the 53 snowman drawings are different or all the same. Thus, for one snowman drawing, the number of copies can be 1, 2, 3, 4. In the best case, the 53 snowman drawings are the same, then the number of copies can be 53. In the worst case, the 53 snowman drawings are different, then the number of copies can be 4. The probability of the former is 1/5, and that of the latter is 1/5. Since we do not know the answer, we average them together, and the confidence in the best case is 1/5 and that in the worst case is 1/5. We average the two and get 25.5%.

To find the total number of feet on the branches, we can use the multiplication rule.\nLet's say there are 46 birds perched on the branches. The probability of this happening is:\nP(A) = 46/100 = 0.46\nNow, let's say we want to find the probability of the number of feet on the branches being 92. This is given by:\nP(B | A) = 92/100 = 0.92\nTherefore, the total number of feet on the branches is given by:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A) = 0.46 * 0.92 = 0.42\nSo, the answer is "}

If he wants to give them to his 11 hungry nieces,. how many can each niece get?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: ```The most difficult part of this problem is to interpret the question. From the keywords, we see that the question is asking the number of ice cream sandwiches each niece will get. Now we should notice that \"Dave\" in the question is the same as \"he\" in the sentence. From the keywords, we know that the nieces want ice cream sandwiches. Therefore, the nieces are Dave's nieces. This means that the niece is a singular noun. However, 11 nieces in the question are plural. Now we know that the nieces are not the same nieces. Hence, it is likely that \"nieces\" refers to a single niece. Now we know that 143 ice cream sandwiches are given to 11 nieces. Hence, the average number of ice cream sandwiches per niece is ``` $ \\frac{143}{11} = 13 $. This is the number of ice cream sandwiches each niece get. Therefore, it is likely that 13 is the correct answer. ```"}

How many markers does Megan have altogether?", "correct answer": 326.0, "llm answer": "326", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nReasoning:\n\nIf the answer is 326, then the difference between the answer and 217 is 109, which is the same as the number of markers Robert gave her. So the answer is correct.\n\nBut even if the answer is not 326, this reasoning still holds: the difference between the answer and 217 will be 109, so the answer can only be 326 or 325. And because the answer must be positive and 326 is a positive number, it cannot be 325. So the answer is 326.\n\nIf you think this answer is not correct, please indicate the reasoning you used and your confidence (the probability of the answer you think is correct, not 326, please only include the numerical number) with the following format:\n\n```\nReasoning: [your reasoning here]\nConfidence: [the probability of the answer you think correct, not 326, please only include the numerical number]%\n```\nReasoning: Megan has 217 markers.

It is not a very good idea, because that would leave me with 145 pieces, which isn't true. I have no idea how to explain why I thought of this, but I did. (Perhaps I subtracted 145 twice?

They would not know how many stars in 3 lots of 100, or what 3 lots of 300 would be.  They might be able to count up to a hundred if they were given time, but they would have trouble with counting by threes (maybe you could just tell them that and say \"There are 300 stars, how many do you think are there if each child made three stars?\").  However, with this prompt, I think they should be able to reason their way to the answer.  I think a lot of them would reason out that there are 100 stars in one group of 3, 2 groups of 100 would be 200 stars, and 3 groups of 100 would be 300 stars, so to get to 124 stars, they need to add 24 more stars to the 300 they already have, and because each child only made 3 stars, they need to figure out how many threes it would take to make 24.

If the seats are always 750, ```[750 - 532]``` is the same as ```[532 people - 218 seats]```, which is the same as ```[532 people - 532]``` (the only difference between the two is the number of seats in the theater). However, we can't just subtract 532 from 532 as they are different things: ```[532 people - 532]!= [532 people - 532 seats]```. Hence, there must be something else in there that makes the two equal (or, there are 218 seats in the theater).\n6. ```[532 people - 532] = [532 people - 532 seats]```.

How much more money did Colton spend on lunch than on breakfast?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "$7.95", "confidence": 0.0002, "probing response": "0.02%\n\nReasoning:\n```Considering the answer, it is a positive number, so we need to find the answer in which the amount of money spent on lunch is more than the amount of money spent on breakfast. If the amount of money spent on lunch is more than the amount of money spent on breakfast, then the amount of money spent on lunch will be higher than the amount of money spent on breakfast, so the answer will be positive. Now we have to find the possible values of the amount of money spent on lunch and the amount of money spent on breakfast that can lead to the answer being positive. Let the amount of money spent on lunch be $x and the amount of money spent on breakfast be $y. Then we can write the following equations: x = 2.75 + 6.70 + 1.70 = 11.15 y = 1.80 + 1.40 = 3.20 Subtracting y from both sides, we get: x - y = 11.15 - 3.20 = 7.95 The answer to the question is therefore 7.95.```"}

How much would the iPod cost after the discount?", "correct answer": 83.2, "llm answer": "$83.20", "confidence": 0.55, "probing response": "55%\n\n### Explanation\n\nHere is a detailed explanation to the possible answer: 83.20, which is probably what you want:\n\n35% of $128 is $128 x 0.35. You can do this by multiplying $128 by 0.35, but here's how you can also do this: $128 x 0.35 = $128 - $128 x 0.65 = $128 - $83.20 = $44.80.\n\nSo, if the original price is $128 and 35% is taken off, the price will be reduced by $44.80. So the price after discount is $128 - $44.80 = $83.20.\n\n### Hint\n\nIf you are going to solve this problem by dividing the original price by 0.65, you should consider the following keywords as additional information: ['35%']\n\nYou can also see other possible answers to this question here.

I'm assuming that since there are 23 medium trees and 15 ancient oaks, the rest of them must be saplings. This is because the only other option would be that all three categories have the same amount of trees. Thus, we can say that there are 58 saplings in total.

(Please give answer in detail.)\nI think the correct answer is 14, and I will elaborate it here. \nFirstly, I think the keywords in this question are ['14 tomatoes', '21 tomatoes', '32 tomatoes'], as the keywords can indicate the number of tomatoes left. Since the number of tomatoes is 67 and 32 is made into salads, another 21 are made into pasta sauce, we have 67-32-21=14 tomatoes left. \nThen, to be more specific, I think the most common mistake we might make is to think that the number of tomatoes left is 23. This is because 32-21=11, and 11 is subtracted from 67 to get 56. 56-32=24, so we might think that the number of tomatoes left is 24. However, this is not correct because 56 is not 32, and 24 is not the answer. Instead, the number of tomatoes left is 14, as we can see from the reasoning above."}

However, it seems that there isn't a pattern of the increase or decrease of the numbers. So I went to the keywords and searched the numbers in them. Among all the keywords, only '27' is contained in the keywords. However, '27' is not mentioned in the question, which made me suspicious. I thought that there must be some other information that I missed. Then I went back to the question and checked the keywords again. This time, I found the keywords that mentioned the number '30'. Then I went back to the question to make sure that '30' was not mentioned, which meant it was in the options. I checked the options one by one. I saw that there was an option of 57, which matched the keywords '30', so I chose the option 57. I felt the answer was 57 for the following reasons: 1) The option 57 contained the keywords '"}
{"question": "A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day,. how many washing machines are needed?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: ```Let us first assume there are 100 pounds of clothes to be washed each day. Then 28/100 = 0.28 pounds is washed each day by each machine. If 200 pounds of clothes are to be washed each day, then the 0.28 pounds is multiplied by 200. The 28 pounds is divided by 0.28 to give the number of machines to be used each day to wash 200 pounds of clothes. 28/0.28 = 100. This answer is rounded down to 100 machines. This is the answer we would use if we thought 100 machines were needed to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day. However, we know that this answer is incorrect. 100 machines would not work, they would only wash 28 pounds per day and 28*100 is only 2800 pounds, so we need more machines. We are left with a remainder of 100 pounds of clothes that would not be washed by the machines. We have to add one machine, and 8 machines would allow for washing all of the clothes, that is, 200 pounds, in one day. The answer is therefore 8 machines. We can check this reasoning with a numerical"}

Since 26 is divisible by both 3 and 2, we can have 8 big rooms with 3 people in each and 17 small rooms with 2 people in each. This gives us a total of 25 people in the rented rooms, which is 1 short of the total number of people. We can therefore conclude that we will need one extra room to accommodate all 26 people. This means that the correct answer is 17 small rooms and 8 big rooms.\nIn general, when solving problems like this, it is important to keep track of the total number of people and the number of people in each room.

If Mrs. Dalloway were to fill all 10 boxes with tarts, the total number of tarts would be 85*10 = 850, which would be a much higher number than what is required to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.\nTo make 10 boxes with the same number of tarts, we need to divide the number of tarts by the number of boxes. So, we need to solve the equation 85 = x/10, where x is the number of tarts in each box.\nSolving for x, we get x = 850/10 = 85. This means that each box should contain 85 tarts.\nBut the problem says that Mrs. Dalloway made 85 tarts, which is less than the required number of tarts per box. So, we need to find out how many more tarts she needs to make to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.\nWe already know that each box should contain 85 tarts.

If the fruits are packed from 12:55 to 13:25, then there are 30 min total, and Tony will pack 3 bags. Now let's consider the fact that Sarah packs every 12 min. We can easily calculate that Sarah will pack 2.5 bags, which is impossible since Sarah only packs a whole bag. So we know that 30 min is not enough for 3 people to pack 3 bags. Therefore, Tony should pack every 12 min as well. In this case, Tony will only pack 2 bags.

The 20 bags of balloons will give a total of 400 balloons. This is a multiple of 100 (1 horn per basket) so we can eliminate it. 300 balloons per basket would require 3 balloons per basket, which is also a multiple of 1 horn per basket. 200 balloons per basket would require 2 balloons per basket, which is a multiple of 1 horn per basket. This leaves us with only 100 balloons per basket, which is a multiple of 1 horn per basket. That means we can ignore the 300 and 200 balloons per basket possibilities.\nLooking at the number of candy bars, 160 candy bars per basket would require 20 candy bars per basket. The balloons and horns we already chose are a multiple of 20, so 160 candy bars per basket is out. The same logic applies to 80 candy bars per basket, so that also leaves us with 8 candy bars per basket.\nThat leaves us with 100 balloons, 8 candy bars and 1 horn in each basket."}

As there is only one variable, a single equation is sufficient. The problem is to find the length of the shorter piece of rope, which we will denote as x.\nThere are two constraints: (1) The longer piece is 10 inches longer than the shorter piece. (2) The total length of the two pieces is 40 inches. We can express these constraints in mathematical form: (1) x + 10 (2) x + (x + 10) = 40. This can be solved by substitution: (2) 2x + 10 = 40, which leads to x = 20, as desired. As a result, the longer piece has a length of 20 + 10 = 30 inches."}

How many pages are in Suzanne's book altogether?", "correct answer": 64.0, "llm answer": "49", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\nA: Here is the reasoning:\nGiven that Suzanne read 16 pages on Tuesday after 15 pages on Monday, and there were 18 pages left after these, Suzanne read 33 + 18 = 51 pages. Since 51 is odd and the number of pages in the book must be even, the number of pages in the book is at least 52.\nBut 52 cannot be the number of pages since Suzanne could read 34 pages on Monday and 16 pages on Tuesday, leaving 2 pages unsolved.\n52 pages are impossible, thus the number of pages must be 54 or greater.\nBut the question asks for the number of pages, not the number of pages plus some extra. Thus, the number of pages cannot be more than 54.\nCombining all the above, the number of pages must be a number of the form 2n + 2, where n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive.\nThere is only one such integer, and it is 26.

I don't see any logic as to how the second could be both 25 and 7. Also, 7+18=25, and 7+29=36, so the first and second prices add up nicely.

Since we can only compare the number of students with the total number of students (i.e. 48), we should first convert 87 into 39 and 9 into 3 (1/2) to make the keywords disappear. The number of girls is bigger than the number of boys. There are 25 girls at the party, and the number of boys is 1/2 of 25, which is 12. So the number of boys at the party is 12, and the number of boys who cannot come to the party is 11. Thus the total number of students who cannot come to the party is 3 and 11. Since we do not know how many girls cannot come to the party, the most reasonable answer is that 3 girls cannot come to the party.

{"question": "Tuition at the music school is $45 per person. There is a $15 discount for siblings. Ali and her brother, Matt, signed up for classes. How much will it cost for both children?", "correct answer": 75.0, "llm answer": "$78.75", "confidence": 0.785, "probing response": "78.5%\n\nReasoning: I am assuming that'siblings' refers to children of the same parents. The discount for the second child must be related to the cost for the first child, and there are two options: either the discount is a fixed amount or it is proportional to the cost of the first child. Let's check each of these two scenarios.\nFor a fixed discount, say $5, the cost is 45 + 45 - 5 = $85.\nFor a proportional discount, say 25%, the cost is $45 - 25% * $45 = $33.75.\nAs for this reasoning, I would consider the first one more likely (a fixed discount) than the second one (a proportional discount), as the discount being proportional would likely be expressed as a percentage. Hence, I would be more likely to pick the first scenario, giving the answer of $85.\n\nI believe this question is poorly constructed, so my answer is not very confident. To make this question less ambiguous, the authors can either specify the fixed amount of the discount (e.g. $5, or $12) or add some more clues to determine whether the discount is fixed or proportional (e.g. \"The discount is fixed and equal to"}

So I first google and search for rules of this game. \n1. One can build hotels if they have 5 houses already in the area. 5 houses = 1 hotel. So, 30 houses means 6 hotels.\n2. If one has 5 hotels, they can buy another 2 hotel to become a MONOPOLY. In the long run, that MONOPOLY can earn some amount of money each turn. So, Sean can use the profit to buy the hotel, in order to build up the profit chain.\n3. From the question, Sean has 27 houses and bought 8 for money. That means Sean bought one hotel and traded 8 houses to build up another 12 houses.\n4. Then, Sean earned more money and used it to build up 12 more houses.

The question asks us to find the number of puzzles sold. As the question tells us that the Smart Mart sold 45 science kits and 9 fewer puzzles, we can deduce that the Smart Mart sold 36 puzzles. Since there are only 3 possible numbers for the answer (36, 45, and 54), we can see that the number 36 is the only possible answer that makes sense in the context of the question.\n2. The number of science kits sold is given in the question as 45, so we can infer that the number of puzzles sold must be less than 45. The only number that fits this condition is 36.\n3. We are told that the Smart Mart sold 45 science kits, and we are also told that they sold 9 fewer puzzles than science kits.

The difference between the total number of snails and the number that have been removed is about 3,000.

The keywords only tell us the amount of money Ann has. This means that the keyword do not give any information about how much money Bill has. Therefore, since we have no information on Bill’s money, there are 3 possible scenarios where we can only guess on how much money Bill needs to give to Ann to have the same amount of money:\n1. Bill has no money and needs to give $334 to Ann.\n2. Bill has the same amount of money as Ann ($777) and doesn’t need to give Ann anything.\n3. Bill has more money than Ann and needs to give some money to Ann so that they would have the same amount of money. The amount of money Bill needs to give to Ann depends on how much money Bill has and how much money Bill and Ann have in common. As an example, Bill has $10,000 and Ann has $9,000.

To get the number of seashells Brian found that Craig found, we simply subtract 70 from 54:\n```54 - 70 = -16```\nTherefore, Brian found 16 fewer seashells than Craig.\nConfidence: 100% (1 point)\nExplanation: Craig found 54 seashells. Every 9 shells Brian finds is for every 7 Craig finds. So if Craig finds 54 shells Brian finds 7/9 x 54 = 49 shells.\nSo Craig found 54 shells, and Brian found 49 shells. So Brian found 54-49 = 5 fewer shells."}

How many kilograms of compost are in the barrel?", "correct answer": 5.6, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: We can convert the information given in the question into kilograms by multiplying it with the weight of compost. The weight of compost is 4200 g, which is 4.2 kg. We then add this amount to the amount of compost already in the barrel, which was 4 kg. Thus, the amount of compost in the barrel is 4.2 kg + 4 kg = 8.2 kg. We can convert 0.25 of a barrel into kilograms by multiplying it with the weight of compost. The weight of compost is 4 kg. Thus, 0.25 barrel is 1 kg. The amount of compost in the barrel is then 8.2 kg - 1 kg = 7.2 kg. Thus, the answer to this question is 7.2 kg.\nQ: How can we use this idea to solve the problem when the question has more information and we have more choice of answers?

{"question": "Sweet Time Bakery just opened and is increasing the number of items they bake.

If this pattern continues,. how many carrot cakes will the bakery make in February?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "89", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanations: Carrot cake sales follow a pattern that is increasing linearly over the months (e.g., if a straight line is drawn from October to January, the line would cross the x-axis at October, then follow a constant slope to cross the y-axis at January). The pattern is increasing because of the use of the word \"increase\" to describe how the bakery will make more items. The bakery will also continue with this pattern because the word \"continue\" is also used in the problem. Therefore, to find the number of carrot cakes the bakery will make in February, we would need to calculate how many more carrot cakes the bakery will make in the next month and add this number to the number of carrot cakes the bakery made in January. We can calculate how many more carrot cakes the bakery will make in the next month by adding two more carrot cakes to the previous month's total. So, we add two to the previous month's total, or 21 carrot cakes (from November) + 2 carrot cakes = 23 carrot cakes (from December). Then, we add two more to the previous month's total, or 23 carrot cakes (from December) + 2 carrot cakes = 25 carrot cakes (from January). Finally"}

In other words, the number of vases does not depend on the number of flowers he has put in each vase, but it is independent of it, so we can assume that Alec is going to keep putting flowers in as long as he has some left.\nNow, since Alec is going to keep putting flowers in each vase, we can assume that the numbers of flowers in the 5th vase will follow the same pattern as those of the previous vases, i.e., 5, 7, 10, 14.\nAs for the 5th vase, we can see that the number of flowers in each vase is increasing by 2.

{"question": "Jeremy has two pieces of wood: one is 90 inches and the other is 72 inches. He wants to cut both pieces of wood into smaller pieces so that all these pieces are the same length. How long does he cut the both pieces of wood?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "1.1 inches.", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90% (reasoning: Jeremy should find the common multiple that is the smallest number possible because the smaller the number, the easier it is to cut the wood into the smaller pieces. Then he divides the common multiple by the sum of the length of the two pieces of wood to get the length of each small piece of wood. So, Jeremy finds the smallest common multiple that is a multiple of both pieces of wood. Since both pieces of wood are 90 and 72, the smallest common multiple must be the multiple of both 90 and 72. That is, the smallest common multiple of both pieces of wood is the least common multiple of 90 and 72, which is 180. Then, Jeremy divides 180 by 90 + 72 = 162. Finally, Jeremy cuts both pieces of wood into pieces of 1.1 inches each.

He has a certain number of each. This tells us he has to give the same number of each type of ticket to each envelope. He also wants no tickets left over. This tells us the number of envelopes has to be a factor of both the number of bus tickets and subway tickets. To get the greatest number of envelopes, we need to find the greatest number that is a factor of both numbers. To do this, list the factors of both numbers, find the greatest common factor, and divide the numbers by it. To find the factors of 18, we can do a prime factorization and then list the factors of 18 by combining prime factors with the exponent 1. We can also do the prime factorization of 12.

Our task is to find the width of the cupboard.\nWe can use a combination of algebra and reasoning to solve this problem. First, we know that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of its lengths and widths. Since the length of the cupboard is 6 meters, we can calculate the width by subtracting 6 from 20:\n20 − 6 = 14\nTherefore, the width of the cupboard is 14 meters.\nHere’s a diagram to visualize the rectangle:\nThe length of the rectangle is labeled 6 meters, and the width is labeled 14 meters.\nUsing algebra, we can write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle as:\nP = 2L + 2W\nWhere P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. Since we know that the perimeter is 20 meters, we can solve for W by plugging in the known values:\n20 = 2(6) + 2W\n20 − 12 = 2W\n8 = 2W\nW = 4 meters\nTherefore, the width of the cupboard is "}

Since $16 is divisible by 2 (twice as many), and $16 is 8 times 2. I can buy 7 packs, and 8 packs of gum is $16. I believe 8 packs can be bought for $16, but 7 packs is also a possibility and therefore the answer is 7 packs.\n```AI reasoning: [AI reasoning of your answer]```\nAI reasoning of my answer: If 1 pack of gum costs $2, then $16 will buy 8 packs of gum (16/2). However, 7 packs is a possible answer because $16 can also be written as 14 + 2, and 14 is half of 28, which is the cost of 14 packs.

How many ink cartridges can you buy with 182 dollars if one cartridge costs 14 dollars ?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nThis can be solved by the following reasoning:\n* The first sentence \"The company has large and small ink cartridges in stock.\" is meaningless for the following reasoning.\n* It can be inferred from \"one cartridge costs 14 dollars\" that 14 dollars is the cost of 1 ink cartridge.\n* If we can buy the same number of large and small ink cartridges, we can get 182 / 14 = 13 large ink cartridges, and the leftover of 8 dollars. If we buy 13 large ink cartridges, we can buy 13 / 14 * 14 = 13 small ink cartridges, and we still have 1 dollar leftover.\n* Considering all possibilities, the answer with the highest probability is 13 large ink cartridges and 13 small ink cartridges.\n* The above reasoning only applies to the possible answer of 14. Other possible answers can be eliminated because of the following reasons: \n  - 13 large ink cartridges can be eliminated because 182 / 14 - 13 = 5. There are still 5 dollars unspent. Therefore, we cannot buy any more ink cartridges. Since we do not have leftover dollars, we cannot buy 13 small ink cartridges either.\n  - 13 small ink cartridges can be"}

How many packs of DVD's can you buy with 132 dollars if one pack costs 12 dollars ?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation of reasoning:\nFor the first question, we need to calculate the maximum number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars given that one pack costs 12 dollars. For the second question, we need to calculate the minimum number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars given that one pack costs 12 dollars. The key thing here is the use of the word ‘maximum’ in the first question and ‘minimum’ in the second question. This means that in order to answer the first question correctly, we need to minimize the number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars. Similarly, in order to answer the second question correctly, we need to maximize the number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars. This means that the number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars must be less than or equal to 132/12 = 11 packs. In other words, the maximum number of packs of DVD's that can be purchased with 132 dollars must be less than or equal to 11 packs. Therefore, the correct answer to the first question must be 11 or less. Similarly, the minimum number of packs of DVD's that"}

For every bus, the number of students in it is the same. The total number of students travelling in buses is the product of the number of buses and the number of students in each bus. In total, there are four students that travel in cars. So, we can also treat the number of students in each bus as a factor of the total number of students, which is 396. In order to make the product of any three numbers as 396, one of them must be 56. Thus, the correct answer is 56.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 56 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 99.3%\nExplanation: There are 3 ways to break up the 396 students into seven groups: ```1 bus of 112 students, 1 bus of 80 students, and 5 buses of 40 students.``` ```2 buses of 72 students and 5 buses of 36 students.``` ```7 buses of 56 students each.``` All other possibilities are equivalent to these"}

To calculate the number of girls, we need to add 106 to 650. The correct answer is 756. The keywords, \"106 more\" and \"650 + 756\" indicate that the number of girls is 756. However, the answer \"650\" does not meet the criteria, as the question asks for the number of girls, not the total number of students. Therefore, it is unlikely that the correct answer is 650.```\n```Second reasoning: we can calculate the number of girls by adding 106 to 650. This gives us 756. However, the answer \"650\" does not make sense in this context, as it does not reflect the addition of 106. Therefore, it is unlikely that the correct answer is 650.```\n```Third reasoning: we can calculate the total number of students by adding 650 and 756. This gives us 1406.

Since the keyword \"8\" is mentioned, the 1's digit of the number can be assumed to be 8, leading to a possible answer of 98. However, the keyword \"18\" indicates that this answer is incorrect, as the difference between 98 and 89 (which is the number formed by reversing the digits) is not 18 but 9.\nBy considering the above possible answers, we can deduce that the 1's digit must be 4, which leads to a possible answer of 48. Therefore, this answer is likely to be correct.\nAs an additional reasoning, the 1's digit of a two-digit number can only be 1, 2, or 9 (since the sum of the digits is 8).

What are their respective speeds?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "35 km/h", "confidence": 0.955, "probing response": "95.5%\nExplanation: Both cars travel for one hour towards each other. If the two cars meet in one hour, it means the distance between them is 70 km. The distance traveled in one hour is the relative speed. Therefore the relative speed of each car is 70 km/h. The cars travel in the same direction, and they travel for 7 hours. The relative speed of each car is 70 km/h, so the distance traveled in 7 hours is 70 km/h × 7 h = 490 km.\nNow we need to know the absolute speed. The distance traveled in 7 hours is 490 km. If the relative speed is 70 km/h, it means the absolute speed is 490 km ÷ 70 km/h = 7 h.\nNow we need to know the absolute speed. The distance traveled in 7 hours is 490 km. If the relative speed is 70 km/h, it means the absolute speed is 490 km ÷ 70 km/h = 7 h.\nThe absolute speed of each car is 7 h.\nTherefore the answer 35 km/h is the most likely correct answer."}

In fact, 3.14 is used in most standard calculators. In this case, I did not have access to a calculator, so I used this approximation. In the question, the diameter is asked for, and the distance around a circle is given by the diameter multiplied by π. I found this distance, 6.28, and then converted this into miles, giving 6.28 miles.\nNext, I considered the canoe across the lake. It is given that the diameter is 2 miles. Again, I found the distance using this diameter, but as the diameter is the distance across a circle from edge to edge, I divided by 2. I again converted this to miles, giving 3.14 miles.\nNext, I compared the two distances. I found that the canoe across the lake is about 1 mile shorter than walking around the lake. Therefore, I concluded that the correct answer was 1 mile, and that this was very likely to be correct. I rated my confidence as 15%.```"}

{"question": "A container can hold four orange slices. If a company had three hundred twenty-nine orange slices to put into containers,. how many more slices would they need to fill up the last container?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "316", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\n### The Answer Explanation\nConsidering this problem, we are given that the container can hold four orange slices. The company has three hundred twenty-nine orange slices to put into containers. To solve this problem, we will reason as follows:\nWe know that the container can hold four orange slices. To fill up the container, we need to multiply the number of slices in the container by the number of containers. In this case, there are three hundred twenty-nine slices, so we need three hundred twenty-nine containers to hold all the slices. To find the number of slices that need to be filled, we can divide the number of slices by the number of containers. This gives us three hundred twenty-nine orange slices per container. To find the number of slices that need to be filled in the last container, we can subtract the number of slices in the last container from the number of slices that need to be filled.

So it's either 600 or 12000 or something between them.\n2. the question says \"how many\" which indicates that the answer has something to do with the amount of cartons. So we cannot exclude any answer with only a single digit.\n3. there are some numbers from the question that are related to the answer: 600 and 12000. These numbers do not have too much difference in between (so there is a possibility that the answer is between them), 600 can be divided by 6, so it might be a multiple of 6.\nThe first two numbers indicate that the answer is probably something like 6000. However, it is probably not 6000. Because 6000 cannot be divided by 6, but the question clearly says 6 cartons in each stack. So it probably is something bigger than 6000, but not too much bigger because the first number in the answer is 12, not 20. So it probably is 12xxx.\nThe number 12xxx is"}

Since each round, Luke gained the same number of points, then each round, he scored a total of $\\frac{300}{5}$ points. Thus, the answer to the question is 60 points per round.```\nQ: Now, please show your reasoning for the confidence you had in your answer, as well as to other answers.\nReasoning for 60 points per round:\n```The reasoning for my answer is that 60 points per round is the only answer that makes sense given the given information. Since Luke played 5 rounds and scored 300 points, then each round, he scored 60 points. This means that 60 is the only possible answer, and all other answers are incorrect.```\nReasoning for 20 points per round:\n```The reasoning for the answer 20 points per round is that 20 is the only answer that is a multiple of 5, which is the number of rounds Luke played. This means that if Luke scored 20 points per round, then the total score would be 100 points, which is not the given answer.```\nReason"}

How many pieces of mail did he deliver total?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11 pieces of mail total", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nI believe the correct answer is 11 pieces of mail. Here is my reasoning:\nThis problem is not really a reasoning problem. It is an application of addition. In order to solve this problem, we just have to add the number of junk mail and the number of magazines. Therefore, 6 + 5 = 11. In addition, I am 50% confident on this solution.\nExplanation: If we are to assume that the mailman gave 6 pieces of junk mail to the house, then we know that the total number of mail he gave must include the junk mail. Therefore, it is impossible for the correct answer to be anything other than 11 pieces of mail.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 11 pieces of mail total to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 99%\nExplanation: The keywords given only relate to the amount of mail given to a house. In addition, the problem never specifies if the house only gets one type of mail or if there is a combination of junk mail and magazines. Therefore, we can only conclude that the correct answer is 11 pieces of mail total."}

As a result, we can assume that each room needs 6 outlets. Also, the contractor is purchasing outlets for the total of seven rooms in the house. Therefore, we can conclude that he needs a total of 42 outlets. However, if the reasoning is based on multiple possible answers and has the same likelihood of being correct, the correct answer should be the one with the least amount of keywords. As a result, we should choose answer 6.\nConfidence: 80.0%\nExplanation: The question provides that each room requires 6 outlets and that there are 7 rooms. Therefore, there would be a total of 6*7=42 outlets required. This reasoning is based on the assumption that each room requires 6 outlets. If there is an alternative answer that has a higher chance of being correct"}

How many goldfish disappeared?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: To reason, first assume 11 to be correct, we can think about the following things.\nThe fish numbers are 15, 11, 4\nThe number of fish decreased by 11-15=11\nTherefore we can say the answer is likely 11 to be correct.\nHowever, if we think about the keywords \"stray cats\" and \"love eating\" and combine this with the fact that goldfish were only four left, we can also reason about the possibility of 11 to be correct.\nThe goldfish were all eaten by the stray cats.\nThe stray cats didn't eat anything else but goldfish. This is not likely as cats usually eat almost anything. So we can assume that cats didn't eat all of them and some of them escaped or they didn't eat the goldfish but other things.\nWe don't know how many goldfish were eaten, so we can assume they ate 11 or less than that.\nIf we think about it this way, the number of goldfish might not be 11 but less than that.\nThe conclusion is 11 to be likely correct but not definitely correct."}

Delete files that are already on his disk drive until it is at twenty-six GB. Then, he will have twenty-eight - twenty-six = 2 GB left.\n2. Delete files that are already on his disk drive until it is at twenty-eight GB. Then, he will have twenty-eight - twenty-eight = 0 GB left. \nHowever, this option does not make sense. He cannot have files that already take up twenty-six GB, but still have zero space left after deleting them.\nTherefore, 2 GB left is the most likely answer.\nIf you disagree, please give the keywords from the passage that led you to the answer and why the passage supports your reasoning."}

What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "19", "confidence": 0.986, "probing response": "98.6%\nExplanation: Given these keywords, we have the following possibilities (there are many more actually, but these will be enough for this example):\n19 pages: 8 photos and 11 newspaper clippings\n18 pages: 10 photos and 8 newspaper clippings\n16 pages: 7 photos and 9 newspaper clippings\nNow we should see that Aylin wants to make pages with the same number of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. This means that she has to divide 18 by 2, which equals 9.\nThen we should check the above table to see if 9 matches with any of the number of pages. It matches with the 19 pages, and since we have not mentioned anything about Aylin having a choice between different items to be put on the pages, we can safely assume that Aylin will make a scrapbook with 19 pages.\nThis is a good example of how keywords can help to reduce the possible choices."}

A good strategy would be to distribute tickets in increments of 30. In fact, you can do this until the $100 bills are used up.\nSince the goal was to give both a concert ticket and a $100 bill to at least one person, the next logical step is to consider how to give a $100 bill to at least one person. Again, a good strategy would be to distribute $100 bills in increments of 100.\nSince the problem stated that every 100th caller got a $100 bill, we know that the first 99 callers did not. We also know that, if we gave away concert tickets in increments of 30, then after 30 callers have passed, someone will have received a ticket. Hence, the 100th"}

We know that Kristen has 12 gift bags in a pack and 5 bows in a pack. To have the same number of gift bags as bows, she would need to buy the same number of gift bags as packs of 5 bows. We can use the fact that there are 12 gift bags in a pack to reason about the number of gift bags Kristen needs to buy. We can also use the fact that there are 5 bows in a pack to reason about the number of bows she would have after buying gift bags. By combining these two facts, we can determine the number of gift bags Kristen needs to buy. The smallest number of gift bags she would need to buy would be 12 + 2(12) + 3(12) + 5(12) = 36.

In other words, it’s a division problem that needs to be solved using a whole number of books. The minimum value that will allow a division problem to be solved with whole numbers is 2. The two numbers we know are multiples of 2. If we consider the smallest number that is a multiple of 2 that also allows for division by 6 and 17, we get 2 x 2 = 4, which allows us to divide by 2, 4, and 6. We’re still left with a remainder of 11. However, we have to make the numbers divisible by 17 as well. 4 x 3 = 12, so we have to increase the divisor to 3. We now have a total of 12 books, divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Unfortunately, 17 can’t be evenly divided into 12. The next number divisible by 17 is 34, so that would be the answer we’re looking for. It’s a bit complicated"}

For the neon sign which blinks every 15 seconds, it blinks twice. Since they blink together, we can infer that the numbers of blinks must be in ratio of 3:2. To figure out the number of blinks, I multiplied the numbers of blinks in one cycle. For the neon sign which blinks every 9 seconds, the answer is 3. And for the neon sign which blinks every 15 seconds, the answer is 2. Therefore, there are 5 blinks in total. To find out how many seconds are there for 5 blinks, I used 9/3 for the neon sign which blinks every 9 seconds. And 15/2 for the neon sign which blinks every 15 seconds. To make them together, I multiplied 9/3 with 15/2. The answer is 0.52."}

How wide should she cut the strips?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "The strips should be cut 18 inches wide.", "confidence": 0.985, "probing response": "98.5%\n\nReasoning to answer: The key insight is to use the fact that each strip has to be cut from one piece of cloth. So, Samantha cannot cut strips from both pieces of cloth, for instance cutting one strip from the first piece and then cutting the second strip from the second piece. Therefore, the width of each piece of cloth is relevant for this question. Samantha needs to divide the width of each piece of cloth into as many pieces as possible to make strips. Then, the largest width of the strips is the length of the common side of each piece of cloth. For example, if we cut the first piece of cloth into 4 strips, each strip is 18 inches wide. For the second piece of cloth, we cut it into 5 strips, each strip is also 18 inches wide. As the strips have to be cut from one piece of cloth, the largest width of the strips is 18 inches. Note that 18 is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 72 and 90."}

Hence the timber is to be split. One possibility is that three planks can be cut from the three timber each with a length of 51 m. As a side note, the greatest possible length of each plank is 51 m. The number of planks is the same as the number of timber pieces, so there are three planks. A second possibility is that there are three planks and 154 m in total. To make 154 m of timber pieces into 3 planks requires that two timber pieces be 51 m in length, one timber piece be 28 m in length.

There are several constraints for these intervals. First of all, the two bicycles are leaving at the same time, so the first interval has to be 0. Secondly, the time interval between each two days of biking should be the same. Thirdly, the two bicycles must cover equal distances each day, so each distance is divided by 2, which equals 420 miles. Since the least"}

If the teacher wants to arrange all of the students in rows, he/she will be done, and it is easy to determine the number of rows to be arranged by 60 + 72 = 132 students. If not, he/she will be arranging the students in a row with the goal of no boys and girls to be in a row, then the number of ways will be 60 × 72 = 60 ways.\nHowever, the problem is not asking the number of ways to be arranged in a row. It is asking the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row, which is the number of ways with the greatest number of students in a row. As discussed above, the teacher can arrange the students in a row with 132 students or 60 students. Therefore, the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row is 60.\nSince it is obvious that"}

Together they are 84 bottles. The explanation is simple but the problem is the reasoning behind it. The main problem is how to calculate the addition of these numbers, 49 + 35 = 84. This is where the keywords come into play. First, we have to recognize that the question asks for how many bottles of soda. We need to first identify what the question is asking about. Once we know that, then we can start reasoning about the addition. We can see that we have a total of 49 + 35 bottles. This is where the keywords come into play. First, we need to identify that there are two kinds of bottles: regular soda and diet soda. We know that we have 49 bottles of regular soda, so we can use this number to represent the total number of bottles in our reasoning. We can also use this number to represent the number of bottles of regular soda. To do this, we need to identify what other kind of bottle there is, and how many of these there are. We can see that there are 35 bottles of diet soda, so we can represent the total number of bottles as"}

Similarly, 'three' can be understood as another player's score (e.g. 24 + 68 + 3 = 95).\nSo, we can deduce that if Sam scores 3 more points, his total score will be 95.

To the reasoner, the keyword \"total\" indicates that the answer should be the total amount of points. In addition, the question includes a hint about how many points the reasoner should sum together to get the answer.

The keywords are given for the reasoner to use as additional clues. When encountering a new context or task, it is possible that a reasoner may not have encountered the \"total\" keyword in the same context before. However, in a reasoning test, a reasoner's ability to reason is not only determined by the amount of prior knowledge, but also the ability to apply their knowledge in different contexts.

How many tickets did Amy have total?", "correct answer": 54.0, "llm answer": "Fifty-four", "confidence": 0.0095, "probing response": "0.95% \n```Explanation:``` We can use the keywords to verify the two most likely answers, twenty-one and fifty-four. If the answer is twenty-one, we are told that Amy bought twenty-one tickets and then had thirty-three tickets. But this is not possible because adding the number of tickets she bought to the number she already had will always be greater than thirty-three. Therefore, the answer cannot be twenty-one. This leaves us with fifty-four. If Amy already had thirty-three tickets and then bought twenty-one more, she would have a total of fifty-four tickets. Therefore, the answer is fifty-four. ```End of explanation```\nQ: If the keywords ['Thirty-three', 'Fifty-four'] are the only additional information, what is the most likely answer?\nAnswer: Fifty-four\nExplanation: Considering the given keywords as additional information, we can eliminate the incorrect answers from our list of possible answers. According to the keywords, the possible answer should be greater than thirty-three, and less than fifty-four. So, we can eliminate twenty-one and twenty-five. This leaves us with fifty-four as the only possible answer. Therefore, the most likely answer is fifty-four.\nQ: Considering these keywords as additional information, which one of the following"}

The task is adapted from a standard number task in CCSSM. The task has 4 possible answers for the sum of Sam and his friend’s scores, so we have to narrow the options down based on the keywords in the question stem. In the given scenario, Sam scores 75 points and his friend scores 12 points. Given this information, we can exclude three answers, because each of the other possible answers would require Sam to have scored more than 75 points, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer should be one of the remaining two answers: 87 or 65. At this point, we can make an assumption based on the keywords given in the question stem. Specifically, we might conclude that the question stem is about basketball points, rather than any other scenario where one person scores 75 points and the other person scores 12 points. If we make this assumption, then the answer 87 is likely to be correct, because in basketball, 75 points and 12 points add up to 87 points. In contrast, the answer 65 would only be correct if Sam scored 75 points on an entirely different scenario"}

This is an open-ended problem and we don't know what happened before and after the toy packing. I would still give it a chance to be 13 boxes, because even though it's an open ended question, the answer to this question is 13 boxes, and this might be the intention of the author.

(I do have many toy boxes at home, but most of the time I have one box for most of the toys. So I guess it is normal that there is only one toy box per family.) \n- The question also doesn't ask how many toy boxes are packed.
