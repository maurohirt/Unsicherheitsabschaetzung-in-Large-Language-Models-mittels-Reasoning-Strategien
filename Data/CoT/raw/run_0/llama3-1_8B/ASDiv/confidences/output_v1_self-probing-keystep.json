How many balls does Ellen have?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "15", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning: It seems likely that Ellen has 15 balls. Marin has 9 balls, and she has 6 more than Ellen does. 9 + 6 = 15. Thus, Ellen has 15 balls.\nQ: This problem can be solved by more than one method. Which method did you use to find the possible answer?\nMethod: One method is to read through the problem, find the two numbers (9 and 6) and add them to get the answer. This is the method I used to find the answer to the problem.\nExplanation of the Method: I read the problem and looked for the two numbers 9 and 6. I added 9 and 6 to get 15. I looked for any other numbers in the problem, but I didn’t find any. I then checked the possible answers, and I found that 15 was one of the possible answers, so I wrote it down as the correct answer."}

{"question": "Janet has nine oranges and Sharon has seven oranges. How many oranges do Janet and Sharon have together?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "16", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: We may reason that there are three possible outcomes of the problem; that Janet has seven oranges, eight oranges, or nine oranges. We can calculate the probability of each outcome using the following process: \n- We first divide the number of possible combinations of outcomes by the total number of possible combinations. We then use that quotient to find the probability of a given outcome. For example, to find the probability that Janet has seven oranges, we divide seven by nine and then multiply by two: 7/9 x 2 = 14/18 = 0.78. To find the probability that Janet has eight oranges, we divide eight by nine and then multiply by two: 8/9 x 2 = 16/18 = 0.89. Finally, to find the probability that Janet has nine oranges, we divide nine by nine and then multiply by two: 9/9 x 2 = 18/18 = 1.\n- We then determine which of the three outcomes is most likely to be correct by considering the number of oranges Janet has. Since Janet has nine oranges, the most likely outcome is that Janet has eight oranges, which has a probability of 0.89. Therefore, the most likely answer is"}

How many birds are left on the branch?\" The first clue to what is going on here is that the question gives us a quantity of birds (4) before taking away 1, or one less than 4. This indicates that the question is asking us to subtract 1 from 4. We could then subtract 1 from 4 using the standard algorithm of 4 minus 1 equals 3. This indicates that there are 3 birds left on the branch after one flies away. To answer this question confidently, we would need to know that this reasoning is sound.\nTo see if this reasoning is sound, we can look at a few other examples of the same question structure: \"x birds are sitting on a branch. 1 flies away. How many birds are left on the branch?\" If we take this question and replace the x with 4, we get: \"4 birds are sitting on a branch. 1 flies away.

Let x be the number of pages I read yesterday. Then I read x+17 pages in total. To calculate x, we must know the total number of pages. Suppose the total number of pages is 38. Then, 38-(x+17)=21, that is, 21+x=38, so x=17.\nHowever, to use this reasoning, we must assume the total number of pages is 38. Let us check the assumption. I read 17 pages today. If the total number of pages is not 38, then today I read 17 of those 38 pages. This is not necessarily true. The 17 pages I read today may just be the consecutive 17 pages of a book with 100 pages.

For the first few digits of the answer, multiplication is correct (6 × 2 = 12) but the division step may cause errors (6 × 2 ÷ 2 = 6). To solve the problem correctly, the test taker needs to divide first and then multiply."}

You can choose only integers between 0 and 28 cents, which gives 29 possibilities. However, if the sum of the coins was 0, the answer would be 0. The answer could be 1 coin, 2 coins, … up to 28 coins, for a total of 29 answers. However, 28 coins is not a possible solution, because the amount of money that can be obtained by combining 28 coins is 56 cents. The problem is to find which of these possible answers is the smallest. The smallest is 7. Thus, the minimum number of coins is 7."}

However, the critical reasoning step is not convincing to me that she has exactly 100 cents back. For example, suppose that Kate only has a dime in her pocket, and she has no other coins. Then, she will be back with 54 cents change instead of 100 cents. In addition, if Kate only has quarters in her pocket, she will only have 50 cents back.

Similarly, I compute the probability of the number of salami pieces, which is 0.1 and the probability of the number of bacon pieces, which is 0.3.\nThen I compute the probability of having at least one correct piece of meat by multiplying the probability of pepperoni, salami and bacon together, which is 0.2*0.1*0.3=0.006.\nFinally, I multiply the probability by 3 to obtain the probability of having at least one correct piece of meat and having at least one incorrect piece of meat, which is 3*0.006=0.018.\nSo, the probability of the answer 55 to be correct is 95%.\nThe probability of the answer 55 to be correct is 95%."}

For example, if you consider that Animapolis is located on the planet Earth, the population of Animapolis is probably not more than 5,000,000, then the total workers should not be more than 5 million.\nExplanation of the answer: The correct answer to the question is 862.\nReasoning Explanation: Since the critical step is: Identify the number of beavers hired. They hired 318 beavers, which leads to the conclusion that 318 is a number, so that both 318 and the other number can be added to make the total number.\nPossible answer: 862 is the only answer choice of the four that is the sum of two numbers, both of which are smaller than 318.\nCritical reasoning to the possible answer: First we identified that there are 318 beavers. Then we added 318+544 and 544 is not a multiple of 5, so 544 cannot be the number of spiders.

If he now has 61 stamps,. how many stamps did he receive from his friends?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "27", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nA common pitfall of mathematical errors is to make an incorrect computation. An incorrect computation happens, for example, when we calculate 61-37 instead of 61-34. As the two quantities are very similar, this mistake is very likely to happen. So, when we compute 61-37=24, we get the possible answer 24. We are then confused, because 24 does not look like a reasonable answer, while 27 does. So, we are likely to believe the answer 24. However, since we have reasoned the answer 24 in the wrong way, it is actually incorrect. For the critical reasoning step above, we first compute the difference between the total number of stamps and the initial number of stamps (61-34), which gives the correct answer 27. We then check whether 27 is reasonable. It is a reasonable answer, as it is a positive number and the initial number of stamps was 34, which is reasonable as well. However, if we compute the difference in the wrong way (37-61) and get the answer 24, it is very confusing, as 24 does not look like a reasonable answer.

This is a fundamental step in the process of learning. We are all trying to find the truth about the world, but we are very often biased and we do not know the right answer.

So the answer would be 974 + 487 = 1471 feet. However, the answer choices are not mutually exclusive (some answers have more than one possible answer) and you should consider the other answer choices that are not mutually exclusive with the answer choice you choose. In the case of answer choice 1075 feet, you can reason that if the answer is 1075 feet, the length of the white fiber is 487 feet (which you know is half the length of the blue fiber) and the length of the black fiber is 488 feet (which you can calculate to be 974 ÷ 2 - 487 = 488 feet).

We don’t know exactly how far Rocky Mist is from the city, but we do know that it is farther than Sky Falls by a factor of 50. If Sky Falls is 8 miles from the city, Rocky Mist must be 8 × 50 = 400 miles from the city. The second statement says that Rocky Mist is 50 miles east of Sky Falls. This makes the Rocky Mist Mountains even farther west from the city than they were before. Therefore, Rocky Mist must be 400 miles west of the city.\nQ: Given the information you have, is it possible that the Rocky Mist Mountains are 400 miles east of the city? Why or why not? Show your reasoning.\nPossible Answer: No, the Rocky Mist Mountains cannot be 400 miles east of the city because the first statement says that the Rocky Mist Mountains is 50 times farther from the city than Sky Falls. This would mean that the Rocky Mist Mountains is closer to the city than Sky Falls, which is impossible because the"}

I believe that the student wrote out the steps: 12 pieces of bite-size cinnamon swirls is equal to 12 divided by 2, which is equal to 6. Therefore, Jane ate 2 pieces of cinnamon swirls, which is equal to 2 divided by 2, which is equal to 1. In other words, Jane ate half of the number of pieces eaten by her mom and her sister combined.\nThe correct answer is 2 because it is half the number of pieces eaten by Jane's mom and her sister combined, 6. 6 is also the answer given in the question, which I believe the student read.

I think the 4 flavors, combined with the choice of regular or waffle cone, could generate 8 different combinations. I choose vanilla or waffle cone and I get vanilla waffle cone. If I choose vanilla but regular cone, I still get vanilla waffle cone. If I choose waffle cone but strawberry flavor, I get strawberry waffle cone. If I choose strawberry but regular cone, I still get strawberry waffle cone. So, I have 4 choices of ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, caramel, bubblegum) and 2 choices of cones (regular and waffle) and there is a total of 8 different combinations.

How many pieces of candy did Chris give his friends?", "correct answer": 420.0, "llm answer": "420", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\nExplanation: As stated above, this question can be solved by a multiplication step. We assume that Chris gave an equal amount of candy to each friend, so we multiply the number of friends by the number of pieces of candy he gave each friend. We could also ask: What is the product of 35 and 12? The multiplication of these two whole numbers can be computed in a number of ways. We could, for example, use the repeated addition approach and note that 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 = 420. We could also use the area model, in which we arrange 35 rows of 12 candies. There are 420 candies in total. To answer the question, we must determine whether we are confident that the reasoning step will result in the given answer. We can do so by multiplying 35 and 12 and verifying that the answer is indeed 420. It is the only answer that meets the criteria.\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand the multiplication property of equality. Since the 12 pieces of candy is the same for all 35 friends, we can multiply both sides of"}

To estimate the confidence, I consider the possibility that the number of frogs and legs can be different, e.g. it is not required that the frogs have 4 legs. To estimate the probability, I first assume the frogs are not all identical, then compute the probability to get the number of frogs and the number of legs (the probability to get 4 legs should be zero). This probability is approximately 0.0012. Then I assume that the frogs are identical, then compute the probability to get the number of frogs and the number of legs (the probability to get 4 legs is one). This probability is approximately 0.0001. Then the probability is the average of these two probabilities: 0.0006.\nThe reason for 95%: I did not use Bayesian method, so this number is just for convenience.

If 5 is selected, the problem states that each friend will not get fractional amount of pencils, which can't be the case since 6 friends are being given pencils. So 5 can't be the right answer. Thus, the answer should be 6. Therefore, the probability of the answer 6 being the correct one is 75%.```"}

{"question": "A regular octagon whose sides measure 3 ft each. Find the perimeter.", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24 ft.", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nExplanation: If we know nothing about the question, our best guess would be to assume that the answer is random, and then the answer 24 ft. would be chosen with the probability of 1/10. However, we know that the sides of the regular octagon are 3 ft each, and this tells us that the answer should be a multiple of 3, so our chance of choosing the correct answer would improve if we choose 24 ft., which is a multiple of 3. As a result, we are 40% confident in our answer.\nSolution: The first step is to identify the number of sides of the regular octagon. Since the number of sides is a positive integer, it must be one of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. Once this number is known, it is easy to determine the perimeter, which is simply the product of the number of sides and the length of each side."}

{"question": "Mrs. Hilt bought a notebook for $1.30. She paid with nickels.

Please show the reasoning for your confidence level.\nThe key step here is to divide the number of nickels by 5 in order to determine how many nickels are needed to make $1.30. However, I believe that it is possible to have less than 26 nickels to make $1.30. Because 26 is an even number, I think there may be a way to use an odd number of nickels to make $1.30, which would be a better answer. If I have 25 nickels, then each nickel will cost $1.30 / 25, which is $0.052. I will need to divide $1.30 by $0.052 to determine how many nickels are required to make $1.30. I will use the long division algorithm: $1.30 / 0.052. This means I will divide 130 by 52, and I know that $0.052 is 1/20 of $1.30, so I will put the 0 in the quotient, and the 1 above the 3 in the dividend.

The most important thing to consider is the ounce unit, which is actually the unit we want to know.\nSo how many ounces are there in one gallon? There are 128 ounces in a gallon, which can be converted from 4 quarts * 32 ounces per quart. That means there are 16 cans of Coke (or orange juice) in one gallon. Therefore, 96 is the correct answer.\nHow to Improve Reasoning Ability\nThe above step can be applied to improve your own reasoning. When you think of how many glasses of orange juice there are in one gallon, you can start to think about the quantity of ounces. When you think about the quantity of ounces, it is not so hard to think about quarts, then gallons. Thinking about these three units of measure in that order should give you the correct answer more easily.\nHowever, when you see “one gallon” in the problem, it may be hard to think of the word “quart”. You may want to improve the process to think about these units of measure. You can think of the word “quart” while reading"}

We have to go through the following steps to reason why.\nFirst, we have to see how likely it is for the critical reasoning step to be correct. The reasoning is correct, so we can go ahead to reason about the probability of answer 12 to be correct. To answer this question, we have to use the same method we did for the reasoning step, i.e. divide the number of pages to be read by the number of pages read per day. We can estimate that this step is correct 80% of the time since it has 3 correct digits and the calculation is simple. This means the probability that this step is correct is 0.8.\nThen, we have to combine this probability with the probability that answer 12 is correct given that the critical reasoning step is correct. As discussed, we can estimate this probability to be 100%, which means the probability that answer 12 is correct given that the critical reasoning step is correct is 1.\nThen, we have to multiply the two probabilities together to get the overall probability that the answer is correct, which is 0.8 × 1 = 0.8.\nFinally, we convert the number between "}

Then, we can simply compute the weight of a glass bottle: 1 kg 800 g − 450 g = 1 kg 350 g, and the weight of a plastic bottle: 1 kg 800 g − 450 g × 5 ÷ 4 = 1 kg 300 g. So a glass bottle is 350 − 300 = 50 g heavier. It is the closest to 900 g, so it is 90% likely to be the correct answer."}

{"question": "The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?", "correct answer": 850.0, "llm answer": "500 g", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: Let’s say watermelon weighs 1300 g, which is very common. Then pineapple weighs 1000 g. This is more than enough to give us a total weight of 5 kg 700 g. However, it is too heavy for 4 watermelons. Hence, a watermelon must weigh less than 1300 g, so we could have a pineapple with 1000 g. In this situation, a watermelon weighs 1250 g, and pineapples 1000 g, which are 250 g and 250 g heavier than a pineapple, respectively.\nQ: In the given critical reasoning step, we identified that the weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. It is likely that the 2nd pineapple weighs 500 g. Therefore, the total weight of the 2nd pineapple, 2nd watermelon and 1st pineapple is 5 kg 700 g, and that of 2 pineapples, 2 watermelons and 1 pineapple is 5 kg 600 g. We still have a weight gap of 200 g between the watermelon and the pineapple. Let’s say watermelon weighs 1300 g, which is very common"}

How much heavier is a cake than a piece of bread?", "correct answer": 100.0, "llm answer": "75 g", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: We are given two relations: (a) The weight of 4 cakes is 800 g (i.e. 4 cakes weigh 800 g). So each cake weighs 200 g. (b) The total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g (i.e. 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread weigh 1,100 g). This gives us 3 cakes = 600 g. This in turn means that a piece of bread weighs 200 g ÷ 5 = 40 g. We are also given that the answer should be \"the weight of a cake is 75 g heavier than a piece of bread.\" This translates to the weight of a cake is 200 g + 75 g = 275 g, or 275 g is the weight of a cake.\nThe total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 g (i.e. 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread weigh 1,100 g).\nThis gives us 3 cakes = 600 g.\nThis in turn means that a piece of bread weighs 200 g ÷ 5 = 40 g.\nWe are also given that"}

Let’s use 3 and 5 instead of 8 and 12 as an example, because they are divisible by 3. It means that 5/3 rounds are equivalent to 25 minutes, and the remaining is 30 min. If we use 8 and 12 as an example, it means that there are 6 rounds left with 4 and 8 minutes left in a round, so 30 min. As long as all of the intervals are divisible by 3, the answer will be correct. This should be a good answer.\nThere is still a slight chance that the answer might be 1:00, because 1 hour + 55 minutes = 1 hour 55 minutes, which is the same as 1 hour 55/60.

However, based on our reasoning, we can have a more confident answer. First, we know that Elizabeth studied for two different tests. Second, we know that she studied for 25 minutes for the science test. Third, we know that she studied for 35 minutes for the math test. Fourth, we know that we need to determine how long she studied altogether. So, let's find the answer by using algebra.\nElizabeth studied a total of x minutes. We need to use the distributive property to expand x into 25+x. And then we can add 25 and 35 and see if we get x. 60 + 25 = 85. So, 85 is the total number of minutes she studied altogether.

I have often seen the reason stated as “it’s the longest length and you can’t cut shorter”. But this is not true because he can cut the 15 feet cord to be 14 feet, then the 12 feet cord into two 6 feet cords, then he can cut the 14 feet cord and the 6 feet cord into 4 feet each. So, it is not the longest possible length and you can cut shorter.\nWhat is the longest length you can make them?\nThe correct reasoning is that the maximum length can be 4 feet because 12 feet and 15 feet can be cut into 4 feet segments only. The answer 4 feet is not the longest possible length. In the question, the length of the cord is given in feet. We will calculate the length in feet. The maximum length of the segment can be given by:\n15-15/4 = 0\n12 – 3*4 = 0\nAs the segment should be 4 feet, the answer is 4 feet.

{"question": "The ski resort reported 65 inches of snow in January. They measured 18 inches of snow during the first week. They measured 25 inches of snow the second week. How much snow did they get the rest of the month?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22 inches.", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: Let the random variable $X$ represent the amount of snow in January. We want to find $P(18 < X < 25)$. In this problem, the ski resort reported 65 inches of snow in January, but you only need to consider the amount of snow in January. You can ignore all the other information in the question.\nThe snowfall in January follows a uniform distribution, where the minimum amount of snowfall is 18 inches and the maximum amount is 25 inches. That is, $$X \\sim U(18,25)$$\nWe can use the following steps to find the probability. $$P(18 < X < 25) = \\frac{25-18}{25-18} = \\frac{7}{7} = 1$$ This is the probability that the amount of snow falls between 18 inches and 25 inches.\nFrom the answer choices, we can choose answer (a) 22 inches as the most likely answer because it gives the probability closest to 1, which is $P(18 < X < 25) = 1$."}

{"question": "Carey and Pat are moving chairs to the gym. They agreed to move 74 chairs. Carey moved 28 chairs. Pat has moved 29 chairs. How many more chairs do they have left to move?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Since Pat has moved 29 chairs and Carey has moved 28 chairs, together they have moved 57 chairs. We can calculate how many more chairs they need to move by subtracting the number of chairs they have moved (57) from the total number of chairs (74), which equals 17 chairs.\nThe key to understanding this reasoning step is to recognize that the total number of chairs (74) is the sum of the total number of chairs moved (57) and the number of chairs remaining (17). This is a fundamental concept in arithmetic and is used in many everyday situations. For example, if you know that you need to walk 10 miles to get to your destination, and you have already walked 3 miles, then you know that you have 7 miles left to walk.\nThe reasoning step is important because it allows us to quickly and efficiently determine how many more chairs are left to move. By subtracting the total number of chairs moved (57) from the total number of chairs (74), we can easily calculate the number of chairs remaining (17). This process is known as subtraction, and it is a fundamental operation in arithmetic.\nTo assess the confidence of the answer 17,"}

[Show your reasoning and evidence]\n```I think that answer 1 is the most correct answer because I am confident that answer 1 is correct (40% confidence).```\n```My reasoning is that we have already known that William had 45 hot dogs left to sell, because we have been told that he sold 19 hot dogs during the first three innings and he sold 27 hot dogs during the next three innings. Since the first three innings, 19 hot dogs were sold. In the next three innings, 27 hot dogs were sold. The first three innings and the next three innings are the same amount of time, and 46 hot dogs were sold. That means that if we add up all of the hot dogs that were sold in the first six innings, it will equal to the number of hot dogs that William started with. If William started with 45 hot dogs, it is true.```\n```My evidence is that the question does not state anything about how many hot dogs William started with, so I know that the amount of hot dogs William has at first cannot be an exact number, only an approximation.

If this pattern continues,. how many cupcakes will the baker put on the fifth tray?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "32", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: Since the number of cupcakes on a tray doubles from one tray to the next tray, the cupcakes on the next tray should be a power of 2 greater than the cupcakes on the current tray. The power of 2 corresponds to the tray number, i.e., the tray number is the exponent for the power of 2. As a result, the number of cupcakes on the next tray should be double the cupcakes on the current tray. For the first 4 trays, the number of cupcakes on each tray is 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, and 2^3 = 8, respectively. Based on the power of 2 on each tray, the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray should be 2^4 = 16. However, the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray in the question is 2^5 = 32. Thus, we know the number of cupcakes on the fifth tray is a power of 2 greater than the number of cupcakes on the fourth tray.

Tina can use the shadow of the fence post as a scale of the shadow. When she has the scale, Tina can use it to measure the height of the tree by comparing its shadow to the shadow of the fence post, or by finding the ratio between the shadow of the tree and the shadow of the fence post. The shadow of the tree is 72 feet, and the shadow of the fence post is 12 feet. Therefore, the height of the tree is 24 feet tall.\n5- Confidence: 60%.

Kate’s 21 stickers are known. 7:4 is known. We know Kate has 7 Kate’s stickers. The number of Jenna’s stickers can be unknown. We should set up the equation like: 21/7 = x/4 (Kate has 21 stickers. The ratio of Kate’s stickers to Jenna’s stickers is 7:4. Jenna has x stickers). We need to solve the above equation. 21/7 = x/4. We can cross-multiply to get 84 = 7x. Divide both sides by 7. 84/7 = x. 12 = x. 12 is the number of Jenna’s stickers. 21:12 is the ratio of Kate’s stickers to Jenna’s stickers. (21 and 12 are Kate’s and Jenna’s stickers respectively).\nWe need to round the quotient to the nearest whole number. 12 is rounded to 12. 12 is rounded to 12. 21:12 = 7:4 (21:12 is rounded to 7:4).\n12 is the number of stickers Jenna"}

There are only 5 voters, each one voting 1/5 of the votes. Ben only received 0 votes. Ben’s vote was 0 1/5 of the time. So 1/5 of 10% is 2% of the time. That means 98% of the time, Ben’s vote is not 0. In those cases, his vote could either be 2 or 4. Ben’s vote was 2 6/10 of the time. He received 12 votes, 2/5 of the time. So 6/10 of 10% is 6%. Ben’s vote was 4 1/10 of the time. He received 20 votes, 4/5 of the time. So 1/10 of 10% is 1%. So Ben’s vote is either 2 or 4. 4 is 10% of the time. And 2 is 90% of the time.

However, it's possible that we can't round off any of the numbers since they all have decimals, so 5.19 m is still not exact.\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Subtract 9 from 5.28 to find the length of the board after the carpenter cut it.

The first is to simply compute the number of berries picked for each consecutive bush (up to the fifth bush). This is what was done in the previous reasoning step.\nThe second way is to recognize that each increase in the number of berries corresponds to an increase of one in the bush number. Therefore, if the number of berries increases by one for every bush, it follows that the number of berries will be the sum of the bush numbers for the first n bushes. If Malia picks a total of n bushes, then the number of berries she picks will be n(n+1)/2. In this case, n = 5. n(n+1)/2 = 5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30.\n```The correct answer is 45: [30 + 12 + 7 + 4 + 3] = 30 + 45 = 45 ```"}

If there are 4 items in each of the other 3 sets, then 4 × 3 = 12 T-shirts and 4 × 20 = 80 buttons have been accounted for, and that would mean 12 − 4 = 8 T-shirts and 80 − 20 = 60 buttons would be left to make the 4th set. But Whitney has only 4 T-shirts and 20 buttons left, so we cannot make a fourth set. This means the maximum number of sets Whitney can make is 3."}

What is the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold?", "correct answer": 90.0, "llm answer": "90", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation: Reasoning: The least common multiple of 18 and 5 is 90. So, it is possible that the bakery sold exactly 90 muffins and exactly 90 cookies. We would get the correct answer if the bakery sold 90 muffins and 90 cookies. For other answers to be possible, the number of muffins must be divisible by 18 and the number of cookies must be divisible by 5. (For instance, if the bakery sold 90 muffins and 75 cookies, it would be possible if the bakery also sold 18 muffins and 15 cookies, in addition to selling 90 muffins and 90 cookies.) In each case, the least common multiple of the number of muffins and the number of cookies will be 90. The probability that the number of muffins will be divisible by 18 is 1/6 and the probability that the number of cookies will be divisible by 5 is 1/5, so the probability that both events will occur is 1/6 x 1/5 = 1/30.

How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80\nReasoning:\nBianca wanted to drink exactly 5 bottles of water each day, so she bought 47 bottles when they were on sale. If she drank only one bottle on Monday, the remaining 46 bottles should be able to support 4.6 bottles every day until Friday. But because it is not a complete day, Bianca drank two bottles on Friday and left the remaining 46 − 2 = 44 bottles to support exactly five bottles every day. Therefore, she would need exactly 44 × 5 − 44 = 220 − 44 = 176 bottles in total. There are 50 bottles in total, and 50 − 47 = 3 are left unused.\nAs you may have guessed, Bianca does not have 47 bottles of water. She has 50 bottles, and on the last day she drank 5 bottles of water and left 3 bottles of water unused. So the number of bottles of water she needs to buy on the last day is 3.\nBut how do we decide this answer is the correct answer?

Therefore, to find the number of pieces in each bag, we have to divide the total number of candies by 2. The formula to do this is:\nTotal number of candies divided by 2 = The number of pieces in each bag\n9 pieces divided by 2 = 4.5 pieces in each bag\nTherefore, we need 6 more pieces of candy in each bag to make them equal.\nExplanation: If the question said Luke had 8 pieces of candy, we would just divide 8 by 2 to get 4 pieces in each bag. However, since he has 9 pieces, we can find the value of each bag by taking the average of the two numbers. We find this average by adding the two numbers and dividing them by 2.

Subtracting out a few extra possibilities leaves 12 in 20 chances. The most likely answers are those that are either near the answer, which is 13, or the range of numbers, which are 11–24. Those are 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 24. The other 8 answer choices are unlikely, leaving the chances of 13 at 13 in 24. Another way to look at it is to notice that the range of possibilities is only 13.

The other extreme reasoning would be 39 inches is less than 98 inches, so the difference must be positive. The latter reasoning is more reasonable, so we choose the answer 150.7 centimeters as the correct answer.\nAnswer to this question is: 80%\nExplanation: There are 30.48 centimeters in 1 inch, so 98 inches is equal to 98 * 30.48 = 2984.64 centimeters. 39 inches is equal to 39 * 30.48 = 1186.92 centimeters.

To be more precise, this method only tells us how likely the answer is correct, and the actual answer is not necessarily to be correct.\nFor the second way, we reason our way to the answer, as mentioned earlier that we determined that the portion of eaten notecards was 3/4. From here, we just need to figure out how many notecards your dog ate. We multiply the portion with the total notecards that your dog ate, which is 12. The answer we get is 12 x 3/4 = 36.

How many rose bushes did the workers plant today ?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "65", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nThere are many possible critical reasoning steps but one of the critical reasoning steps was already given above. To solve this problem, we could consider the other possibilities of critical reasoning steps.\nOne of the possible critical reasoning steps is to add the number of rose bushes that the workers planted. First subtract 33 from 98 to get 65. Next add the number of rose bushes that the workers planted to 65 to get the total number of rose bushes in the park, 98. The possible answer for the number of rose bushes that the workers planted is 65.\nOne of the possible critical reasoning steps is to find the difference of the current number of rose bushes (33) and the number of rose bushes that the workers planted. This gives 98 - 65 = 33. The answer for the number of rose bushes that the workers planted is 65.\nOne of the possible critical reasoning steps is to find the product of the number of rose bushes that the workers planted and 33. This gives 65 x 33 = 2,145.

Then, if I multiply both sides by 9, I get the same answer as before.\nAnother Reasoning Approach:\nSince the mother is 44 and Vidya is younger than her by 5 years, Vidya is less than 44 years old. Since Vidya's mother is 5 years older than three times Vidya's age, the mother must be less than three times Vidya's age. Therefore, Vidya's age must be between 1/3 and 44/3.

Let’s let w = width of the rectangle and l = length of the rectangle. So we know that 2w + 2l = 56, so w + l = 28. We know that l = 2w – 8. Since l = 2w – 8, l + l = w + w – 8. l + l = w + w – 8. But l + l = 28. w + w – 8 = 28. w + w = 36. 2w = 36. w = 18. Since w + l = 28, we can subtract w from both sides: l = 28 – w. l = 28 – 18. l = 10. Now, 2w + 2l = 56 is true with w = 18 and l = 10.

We know the sum of the measures of a triangle's three angles is always 180°, and we can also set up the following equation with the variable x representing the first angle of the triangle:\n2. x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180\n3. 6x - 12 = 180\n4. 6x = 192\n5. x = 32\n6. The first angle is 32°. We then use that angle and the three equations set up in step 1 to reason through the other two angles in the triangle.\n7. The second angle is 3 times the first angle, so the second angle is 3(32) = 96°.\n8. The third angle is 2 times the first angle minus 12, so the third angle is 2(32) - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52°.\n9.

{"question": "Math Magazine charges $8 per square inch for advertising. Jason decides to order a half page ad. Each page of the magazine measures 9 inches by 12 inches. How much will Jason have to pay?", "correct answer": 432.0, "llm answer": "$432", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nThis is a perfect example of an application of the “unit rate” concept. The only catch is that the area is computed by multiplying side lengths, while a rate is computed by dividing. I can’t help thinking of this as the inverse process of finding the area of a square with side lengths given; here the side lengths are computed based on the area.\nLet’s start with a simple example. Suppose Jason were to order an ad that was 3” by 4” in size. Then the area would be 12”² (or 12 square inches) and the cost would be 12*8 = 96 cents. So, we’ve found the rate of cost per area.\nIf we call A the area and C the cost, we have C = 8A. This means that the cost is eight times the area.\nNow Jason wants an ad that is ½ page. A page is 12 inches by 9 inches, so the area is 9*12 = 108 square inches. So 108/2 = 54 square inches.\nC = 8A → 54/2 = 27 → C = 8*27 = 216\nSo it looks like it will cost him 216 dollars"}

What is the area of the garden?", "correct answer": 80.0, "llm answer": "260 square feet", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nThe most critical step is to reason the distance around a rectangular garden is 36 feet. To do that, we need to add up all the sides of the garden. If the sides were 10, 12, and 14, then the distance around the garden would be 10 + 12 + 14 = 36 feet. That's a nice way of checking that it's a rectangular garden. We also know that we have two lengths of 10 feet, and two lengths of 26 feet.\nSo far so good. But we're still left with this pesky problem of having a different length and width in the garden. That's a little annoying, because the area of a rectangle is equal to length × width. But we know that the area must be a product of 10 feet and 26 feet. What could it be? We can just test a few options to find out. Let's try 10 × 20. That's too small. Let's try 10 × 30.

(5/3 = 5/3). There are two other answers. The ratio of area of the rectangle to area of the triangle is 2:5. So the other two answers should also satisfy 2/3 = 5/7, where the common factor 7 is the area of the triangle. So, area of the triangle = 40 cm2 and 40 x 2/5 = 16 cm2. So, area of the rectangle = 2 x 16 = 32 cm2 and area of the triangle = 40 cm2 and area of the rectangle = 32 cm2 and area of the triangle = 5/7 x 32 = 40 cm2, which are all three different answers and can be used for checking the correctness.

We can also reduce this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 9, leaving us with 19 / 1, or 19 tickets. So, we need to divide 865 by 9, then reduce, and we get 19 tickets. We can check our answer by multiplying the number of tickets by the number of friends. 19 times 9 equals 171, which is very close to 865. 865 minus 171 equals 694. 694 divided by 9 equals 77. 77 plus 19 equals 96, which is also very close to 865.

If we divide this number by nine, we get 69.55555555 bottles per day. Because the total cannot be split into 69.55555 bottles, there must be a few days with only eight bottles. (In the worst-case scenario, there would be six days with only eight bottles.) So we start by trying eight bottles. This gives 617/8 = 76.625, so the first six days each need nine bottles, but the seventh day needs one extra bottle, and the eight days need five extra bottles. But this is not the correct answer, so we need to consider 68 bottles (in which case, the first 56 days have nine bottles, and the last 68 days have ten bottles). With 68 bottles, 617/68 = 9.09, so the first 56 days each have nine bottles, but the last 68 days each need one extra bottle. In the worst case, there would be 68 days with only one extra bottle.

If the amount of juice poured into each glass is the same, then the amount poured into each glass is equal to the amount of the total juice divided by the number of glasses. Since the number of glasses is 5, the amount of juice poured into each glass is equal to 153 pints divided by 5 glasses or 30.6 pints for each glass.\nThe critical reasoning step here is that each glass must have the same amount of juice poured into it. This means that the amount of juice poured into each glass is not equal to the amount of juice in the vat.\nThis is a logical reasoning problem, so there is no math involved. You are provided with the total amount of juice and the number of glasses, and you must use those numbers to find the amount of juice poured into each glass.

The question is not asking how many pennies are in each stack. So in order to compute the number of pennies in each stack, you must first compute the number of the stacks. So Megan had 516 pennies. There are nine stacks. How many pennies should be in each stack? It is 516 / 9 = 57. In order to have the same amount of pennies in each stack, Megan need to divide all the pennies evenly to each stack. There is no remainder of dividing 516 by 9. So Megan doesn't need more pennies.

First reason: the truck can hold 4 boxes, but the question is asking about 2 boxes, so 871/2 = 436.5. But you can’t have half a trip, so you need to round it up to 437. Second reason: you have to divide that number by the 2 boxes that you want to carry on the trip, so 437/2 = 218.5, and so you need to round up to 219 trips.

For each one, ask the question: how likely is it that the answer option is correct?\nFor the possible answer 113 packs, this is what I think is going on:\nIf a pack of balloons contains two balloons, we are asked to find out how many packs of balloons are required to meet the demand of 227 balloons. We are told that two balloons in a pack, so one pack contains two balloons. In other words, each pack contains two balloons. Therefore, we have to divide 227 by 2 to find out the number of packs required:\n227 / 2 = 113.5\nThis is what we need to do when reasoning mathematically: divide the required number of balloons by the number of balloons in each pack.\nWe can be relatively confident in this answer. It makes good mathematical sense to divide the number of balloons required by the number of balloons in each pack, and then we get 113 packs required.\nIn summary, the answer of 113 packs seems likely, because it makes sense mathematically.\nPrevious Article Previous Article: Question: A company’s sales for last year were $2"}

So the only two possible answers would be 1 and 2. If 163/1=163 then there would be only 1 shelf with all 163 games. However, 163/2=81.5 so you would need at least 2 shelves. The next number you could divide by is 163/3=54.3 which would mean 3 shelves. However, 163/4=40.75 so 4 shelves is not a possibility. This leaves us with only 1 and 2 as the possible answer. 1 is not an acceptable answer because it does not make sense. The 163 games should be split up so that the shelves are even. Therefore, 2 shelves is the only possible answer. \nHow you would explain this to a friend or co-worker, please write in your own words:\nIf you are trying to figure out how many shelves you need to fit a certain number of video games evenly, you first need to determine how many games can fit on each shelf.

First, one should have a prior distribution over the model parameters. Here, it is appropriate to take a flat prior over the area of the new outdoor section, that is, the distribution is proportional to 1. The second concept is Bayesian statistics, which means that we can take the log of the posterior distribution. This way, the integral is additive, which simplifies our computations significantly.\nNow we have a log posterior: ln [A|new outdoor section] ~ ln [1] + ln [A]. Since we have no information about the parameters, we should put a wide prior, which implies that the likelihood will be much more important than the prior. As such, we can ignore the first term.\nThe next step is to estimate the posterior mean. The likelihood function is proportional to ln [A]. Thus, the posterior is proportional to ln [A]^2, which can be used to calculate the posterior mean. As such, the mean is 1/6 square feet, which is very close to 24 square feet,"}

What is the area of the farm?", "correct answer": 56.0, "llm answer": "4.67", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nTo justify this confidence, it is very important to explain reasoning:\nThe area of a farm is the amount of space it covers, which is represented by the number of square units inside its border. If the area is expressed in square units, it will have units of length × length, so in this case, miles × miles, which can be expressed as a square with a mile on each side, such as 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, and so on.\nLet's consider an example: We have a farm with a length of 5 miles and a width of 4 miles. To find the area of the farm, we will multiply its length by its width.\n5 × 4 = 20 square miles\nIf the farm's length is 8 miles and its width is 7 miles, to find the area of the farm, we will multiply its length by its width.\n8 × 7 = 56 square miles\nTherefore, we have the following expression:\nArea = length × width\nWe use this equation to find the area of the farm. But this is not the only way to find the area. We can also use other methods, such as"}

{"question": "There are 15 shapes.

As each element can be chosen from 15 options, the number of possible answers is the number of elements in the group, which is 3 in this case. So we just need to calculate the factorial of 15 over the factorial of 3, which is $\\frac{15!}{3!}$. This is approximately $3000$ groups of three. Note that I used the number of elements in the group (which is 3 in this case) to calculate the factorial of 15. This is because we are dealing with a very large number here, so it is better to use this method than calculating the exact value of 3!, which would make the formula extremely long."}

The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer:\nStep 1: Consider there are 35 glue sticks, and the ratio is 5:2. This means for every 5 glue sticks, there is one glue bottle. There are a total of 2 glue bottles in 10 glue sticks. The classroom has 35 glue sticks, so the classroom has 7 glue bottles.\nStep 2: If 5:2 is a ratio of glue sticks to glue bottles, then 2:5 is a ratio of glue bottles to glue sticks. For each glue bottle, there are 5 glue sticks. There are 2 glue bottles in the classroom, so there are 10 glue sticks in the classroom.\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

Here is one plausible hypothesis:\nWhen the pet store was selling 2 mice, the store made 5.34 × 2 = $10.68. This is because the store paid 7 × 5.34 = $37.38 to buy the mice and then sold each of the 2 mice for the original price, so the store made 5.34 × 2 = $10.68. If we add the amount that the store made selling the 2 mice, 10.68, to the amount that the store paid for the 7 mice, 37.38, we get $48.06. Therefore, the most likely answer to this problem is 37.38.

How much would it cost if you were to buy 6 bags?", "correct answer": 37.4, "llm answer": "$37.38", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: The average cost of a bag of bananas can be thought of as the total cost of the $2 bags divided by the total number of bags. If the bags of bananas were identical, it would cost $6.23 per bag. As it is not possible for the cost of each bag to be identical if the average cost is the $6.23, it is not possible for the cost of each bag to be greater than $6.23. Any answer that exceeds $6.23 should be discounted to a lower probability. I assigned a probability of 5% to the answer $38.38, which is 10% more than $6.23, and a probability of 95% to the answer $37.38. $37.38 is 10% less than $6.23. The probability I assigned to each answer is the probability of getting each result when rolling a 12 sided dice. The number of sides was chosen based on a subjective judgement of the probability distribution of the results, where 0% is 0 and 100% is 12.\nQ: The manager of a fast food restaurant has budgeted $600 for food on Saturday.

So, we need to know the distribution of the number of cents. I don't know how to do this but let's guess: Let's assume the number of cents is uniformly distributed (i.e., the probability of each value is the same) between 0 and 100. (You can also use any other distribution, as long as it is \"smooth\" enough.) So, let's see if 63 cents is a reasonable number, given the above distribution: $ P(\\text{number of cents}=63)=P(0\\leq \\text{number of cents}\\leq 63)=\\frac{63}{100}=\\frac{3}{5} $ (This is true, because the probability of getting between 0 and 63 cents is the same as getting between 63 and 100 cents.)

Note that there might still be a small chance that Roger actually mowed the lawn 16 times (not 15 times) during the spring and summer. That possibility has a probability of 1/100. But because this possibility is extremely unlikely, we say that the number of times Roger mowed in the spring is most likely 6. We have 99% confidence that this is the answer.\nQ: What is the most critical step in reasoning to the answer?\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the answer: Determine how many times Roger mowed the lawn in the spring.

How many cages did the pet store have?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: Each snake can be in one of 2 cages, therefore each snake has a 1 in 2 (50%) chance to be in a particular cage. The number of snakes in each cage is a binomial distribution. If we assume that each snake has the same chance to be in each cage, we can apply the binomial distribution: Probability of having 2 snakes in a particular cage is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 Probability of having 1 snake in each of the 2 cages is 2(0.5^1 x 0.5^1) = 0.5 Probability of having 0 snakes in a particular cage is (0.5)^0 = 1 The probability of having 2 snakes in each cage, 1 snake in each cage, and 0 snake in each cage are 0.25, 0.5, and 1, respectively. If we add the three probabilities together, the total should be 1. However, the sum is 0.75 (not 1) because the assumption of having an equal chance to be in each cage does not accurately represent the scenario.\nThe correct answer is 2 because it is the only answer choice that"}

Since the question doesn’t give us exact number of items left in cart, it makes it quite difficult to assume the number of deleted items.\nAnswer: 5%\nExplanation: To find the most possible deleted items, one may think that the items removed should be close to half of original items and should result in the number of items left which is the other half of original items. i.e. if 18 was the original number, then the item deleted would be 18 – 8 = 10 (or the sum of 8 + 10 = 18). Hence, this seems the most probable answer.\nAnswer: 15%\nExplanation: Although, above answer is the most possible answer but the question is framed in a way that it is difficult to determine how many items are remaining in the cart.

How many tickets did the yoyo cost?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "Thirty-two", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nThe reasoning is as follows: As we have only one answer given in the question, the answer either is or is not correct. We should calculate the confidence in the answer as the probability of the answer to be correct. Therefore, since we calculated this answer to be correct, we have 100% confidence in this answer to be correct.\nThe reasoning here is that we should never be 100% confident in the answer. This is because the answer given in the question might not be the best possible answer, for instance, the answer \"Billy's father\" might be the best answer for the question \"Who is Billy's father?\". If the best answer is not the answer given in the question, the reasoning we give is wrong, even though the answer is right. We should therefore only be 95% confident in the answer being correct.\nQ: How many yoyos can the Billy buy with the tickets he has left?\nPossible Answer: Sixteen\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Calculate the number of yoyos Billy can buy. This is the number of tickets left, which is thirty-two, divided by the cost of the yoyo, which is sixteen. Thus, thirty-two / sixteen = 2 yoy"}

Adam picked 35 strawberries and had 33 left after eating some, which means he ate 2. The most critical step is to identify the total number of strawberries Adam picked, which is 35. This step is important because it provides the total number of strawberries that Adam had, which is essential in determining the number of strawberries that Adam ate. Without knowing the total number of strawberries picked, it is impossible to calculate the number of strawberries eaten. The critical step is the most significant because it sets the foundation for the entire calculation. Without it, there is no way to proceed. Therefore, if the critical step is identified, the calculation will be much easier to solve.\nExplanation: Adam picked thirty-five strawberries, and after eating some, he had thirty-three left. Since Adam had 33 left, we can conclude that he ate 2 strawberries. The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is to identify the total number of strawberries picked.

{"question": "A farmer planted 2 tomato seeds, 10 cucumber seeds and 3 pumpkin seeds. How many seeds did he plant all together?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "15", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning:\n```Because the farmer planted a total of 15 seeds, each of them must have an equal chance to be picked. Therefore, the probability of picking any 1 tomato seed is 2/15. The probability of picking any 1 cucumber seed is 10/15. The probability of picking any 1 pumpkin seed is 3/15. Since the probability of picking a tomato seed is 2/15 and the probability of picking a cucumber seed is 10/15, the probability of picking a cucumber seed must be greater. Therefore, it is more likely to pick a cucumber seed than a tomato seed. The most likely answer is 15 seeds. If this answer is correct, the probability of picking a cucumber seed is 10/15, and the probability of picking a tomato seed is 2/15. Therefore, the probability of picking a cucumber seed is 10/15, which is greater than the probability of picking a tomato seed, which is 2/15. ```\nPossible answer: The answer is 15 seeds.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 15 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nExplanation of confidence:\n```Because the"}

{"question": "At the bank, a customer turned in 2 dimes, 2 nickels and 7 quarters. What is the total number of coins the customer turned in?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: If the total number of coins is 11, then the other coins, if turned in at all, must be dimes and nickels. Since they are of different values, they are always turned in in pairs (2 dimes and 2 nickels) in order to get the same total as that of the 7 quarters. But that means the number of coins must be 11. Since the number of quarters must be a factor of 7 (the number of quarters the customer turned in), it must be one of these numbers: 1, 2, 4, 7. This eliminates possibilities of 4 and 7. Since the other coins must be turned in in pairs of the same denomination, they cannot be dimes and nickels. Therefore, the possible answer must be 11.\nQ: Consider this reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

There are four rows of eight students, so we can calculate the number of students in the first four rows using the following formula:\nNumber of Students in the first 4 rows = 4 rows × 8 students per row = 32 students.\nNow, let’s consider the other 9 students who are in the back row. Since the question does not provide any additional information about where they sit, we can assume that they are evenly distributed across the back row. Therefore, we can calculate the number of students in the back row using the following formula:\nNumber of Students in the back row = 9 students / 8 students per row = 1.125 students (rounded up to the nearest whole number).\nThus, the total number of students in the 4 rows and the back row is 32 + 1 = 33 students.\nWe hope this helps with your reasoning and understanding of the question!\nI am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Google, but I"}

{"question": "For Halloween Frank got ten pounds of candy and Gwen got seven pounds of candy. What is the combined weight they received?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nIn this type of question, it’s helpful to know the weight of a typical piece of candy to determine what possible answer could be correct. Here, the answer should be in the form of 2 + 3 = 5, 6 + 7 = 13, 10 + 7 = 17, or 13 + 7 = 20. Given that we know the total weight of the candy must be 17, it is very likely that the weights of the candy are 10 + 7 = 17, therefore the correct answer must be 17.\nThe most common reason people get this question wrong: To solve for the combined weight, they either add 10 + 7 = 17 pounds (correct), or they multiply 10 × 7 = 70 pounds (incorrect). It is also very easy to just pick 17 as the answer without reasoning the question through.\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: To be on the safe side, you should assume that both Frank and Gwen got the same weight of candy (10 pounds each). That would give the combined weight of 20 pounds. Since 20 pounds is the maximum weight of candy they could possibly receive, it is the possible answer"}

If he can put 7 sodas on each shelf, then we need to find out how many sodas Cody can fit into the fridge. Therefore, 35 + 5 = 40 sodas in total. If we are going to put 7 sodas on each shelf, then we need to find out how many 7’s we can fit into 40 sodas. Therefore, 40 ÷ 7 = 5.5, which means that we need 5 full shelves and 5.5 sodas. However, because Cody can only fit 7 on each shelf, we are not able to put 5.5 sodas in the fridge, so Cody can only fill up 5 shelves. This means that Cody can only fit 7 × 5 = 35 sodas in his fridge. Because"}

In order for there to be three people on each team, two managers would have to be on one team, one manager and one employee on another, and two employees on the third. This would mean one manager and one employee would be left out, so this answer is unlikely. The two remaining managers could be on the same team or on different teams. Also, there could be three employees or two employees and a manager on one team and two employees on another, leaving the last manager and one employee as the third team. I think a better guess would be four people per team.\nThis is a tricky one! I am not sure if there will be three people on each team because there are three managers and three employees. If we split into three teams we are left with one manager and two employees. However, it may be that two managers are in the same team and the rest will be divided into teams of two employees and a manager. However, there is a possibility of a team of two managers and one employee.

Once the total number of minutes required is calculated, the total number of minutes remaining is calculated by subtracting the number of minutes already cooked from the total number of minutes required. Finally, divide the total number of minutes remaining by the cooking time per potato to determine the number of potatoes that need to be cooked.\nThe time remaining is the total time - the time already cooked, which is 6 minutes.\nTherefore, 36 - 6 = 30.\nThe total time remaining is 30 minutes. Since each potato takes 6 minutes, we need to divide the total time by 6.\nDividing 30 by 6 will give us 5.

After Deborah sold 31 boxes, there are 5 boxes left.

Since each case contains 12 boxes, we can divide the total number of boxes (3 + 31 = 34) by 12 to find the number of cases that remain. This leaves 5 boxes that are not packed to a case. It is highly likely that the answer of 5 boxes is correct based on this reasoning.\n"}

So, I can clearly say that it's 4 cases.\nThere are 9 boxes and in 1 case there are 6 boxes so, we have to count how many cases we have so total cases = 9/6 = 1.5 (we can't write decimal because here we are going to consider number of cases). As, it can't be 1.5 case so we can ignore the decimal part.\nNow we are remaining with 0.5 case (it can be 1 or 0). If you go by cases so it's 1 case but as it is not written in options so we can say that it's 0.\n0.5*6=3\nHence, remaining 3 boxes we can consider as extra boxes. So, final answer is 4 cases + 3 extra boxes.\nHence, answer is 4. Hope it helps."}
