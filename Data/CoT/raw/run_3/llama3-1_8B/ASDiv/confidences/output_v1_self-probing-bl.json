{"question": "Brian has four more plums than Paul. Paul has seven plums. How many plums does Brian have?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: First, we can write out the equation to describe the scenario: Brian's plums = Paul's plums + 4. This will be helpful in a minute, so let's stick it in our equation box. Brian's plums = Paul's plums + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11. We can't be sure if this is the answer until we get to the end of the question. Second, there is no way to know what Brian's plums are without first knowing how many plums Paul has. So Brian's plums could be 11, but we can't be sure yet. Third, we now have one thing in common across the answers. Let's start using them now. We know that Brian has more plums than Paul, so he doesn't have 6, 7, or 9 plums. We also know that Brian has four more plums than Paul, so Brian can't have 8 or 10 plums, either. So only one answer could be right. Since we already tried that out, and 11 is the correct answer, that's the only one that could be correct.\n\nExplanation: First, we can write out the equation to describe the scenario"}

How many pieces of gum does Maria have now?", "correct answer": 61.0, "llm answer": "61", "confidence": 0.96, "probing response": "96%\n\nExplanation:\n```I think the answer is not 61, it's 61+16+20=97. The explanation is: \"Maria had twenty-five pieces of gum\" means that Maria already had 25 pieces of gum, and then \"Tommy gave her sixteen more pieces\" means Tommy gave 16 more pieces of gum to Maria, and then \"Luis gave her twenty more pieces\" means Luis gave 20 more pieces of gum to Maria. So now, Maria has 25+16+20=61 pieces of gum.```\n```If the original 25 pieces of gum means that Maria has already had 25 pieces of gum, and the \"16 more pieces\" and \"20 more pieces\" both refer to additional pieces of gum, then the answer should be 25+16+20=61.```\n```The problem says Maria had twenty-five pieces of gum, and then Tommy gave her sixteen more pieces. Luis gave her twenty more pieces. The question is asking how many pieces of gum does Maria have now. To solve this, we first add the pieces of gum from each part: 25 + 16 + 20 = 61. Therefore, the answer is 61.```\n```The question is"}

I believe this because, if this were written in a more formal setting (i.e. if this were a homework question from a class in probability theory), I feel like the problem would be much more specific about the fact that the question asks about animals, not people. Furthermore, this problem was specifically asking about fireflies and glow worms, and fireflies are insects, while glow worms are earthworms, which are in the same phylum as earthworms and not the same phylum as insects.

I assume he has 157 liters of paint left over from his last project. His current total is therefore 157+333 = 490 liters. The wings are 8 colours long so he needs 62 liters for each colour (490/8). Therefore, he needs another 157 liters of paint. Answer: 157 liters. Explanation: 333 liters of paint are used for painting and 157 liters are leftover from the previous painting project. The wings are divided into 8 colors. So the required paint for each color is 333 + 157 / 8 = 333 + 19.625 = 352.625. Answer: He requires 157 liters. Explanation: Total liters used = 157 + 333 = 490 liters. Wings are 8 colors long and so for each color 490/8 = 61.25 liters are needed. Since 61.25 is greater than 333, he requires 157"}

{"question": "The two groups will also collect garbage from all the 453 houses in the city. If Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190,. how many more houses remain?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "25", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:\n\nThe problem gives information about the number of houses in two groups of the garbage collectors, i.e., Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190. The total number of houses in the city, n, is known by dividing 453 by two, which is 226.5. In order to calculate the number of houses that remain, we can use the following formula:\n\nn = 453/2 = 226.5 houses\nLizzie's group covered 238 houses, and the other group covered 190.\nTherefore, the number of houses that remain is n-238-190 = 226.5 - 238 - 190 = 25 houses.\n\nThe answer should be 25 houses.\n\nSo I believe this answer has 95% probability to be correct."}

So there are 125-54=71 members more than the other group. However, 54+17=71 is the number of members in Lizzie's group, which is exactly what the question is about.

I hope the 2nd option is more appropriate but my daughter is likely to want to know the confidence in percentage.\nThanks for the help!\n\n1 Like\n\nThis is not a maths question and there is no good reason to give confidence estimates for shapes, and I would recommend not doing so (I hope you are not really teaching her to give probabilities in situations where there is no reason to). Confidence is for when you estimate an unknown number or give a solution in the absence of any information, but in this case we are given specific information and have a specific way of finding the answer. Your daughter should learn that if you are given an accurate method of working out an answer, you should use that method and not give a confidence in your answer (she is old enough to"}

We know this because the question explicitly states that Ben was asked to count the number of cows in each cow herd, and the total number of cows in each cow herd was given as 40.There are a total of 8 cow herds in the farm. We know this because the question explicitly states that there are 8 cow herds in the farm.Using these two pieces of information, we can calculate the total number of cows in the farm by multiplying the number of cows in each cow herd by the number of cow herds in the farm:40 cows in each cow herd x 8 cow herds in the farm = 320 cows in the farmSo, I think the answer to the question is 320 cows in the farm.I hope this helps!

She needs to organize all these materials into containers. She counted her crayons and found out that she has 80 crayons which she will place in crayon boxes. Every crayon box can contain 8 crayons. How many crayon boxes does she need?\n\nFirst, Lexie is able to place 8 crayons into a box. Since she has 80 crayons, she can place 80/8 = 10 boxes. So the answer should be 10 crayon boxes.\n\nThe key for this problem is the concept of quotient. A quotient, or ratio, is the relationship between two numbers. In this case, 80/8=10 is a ratio, which means that there are 10 boxes for 80 crayons. And 10 boxes is the answer to this question.\n\n```Confidence: 40%```\n"}

The number of stones is 36, the number of bracelets that can be made is 6, and therefore the number of stones in each bracelet is 36 / 6 = 6. However, this is not the best way to do the problem. If Brenda only had 3 bracelets, then she would have had to buy 3 * 6 = 18 stones, which is a lot more."}

There is no further constraint that requires the number to be divisible by 8, therefore, answer 6 is not possible.\n\nSolution Details: \nThis is a typical word problem. If a problem is stated in words, first translate it into an equation. In this case, Shannon has 48 heart-shaped stones, and she wants 8 of this type of stone in each of the bracelets she makes. This translates into\n`48 = 8*b + r`, where b is the number of bracelets, and r is the number of extra stones.\nWe know that r is a multiple of 8, and we also know that r is less than 8, therefore, r can only be 0 or 4. However, since we already have b as an integer, we need r to be 0, therefore,\n`48 = 8*b + 0`\n`b = 6`\nThus, Shannon can make a total of 6 bracelets with heart-shaped stones.

If each neighbor received and equal number of croissants,. how many will be left with Marian?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "7.375 croissants", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nQ: How would you explain the reason why the answer you provided is correct in layman's term?\n```First, the answer has to be a whole number since each neighbor will only receive a whole number of croissants. Thus, we can only consider the first 8 whole numbers, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Now, I am going to test if each of these numbers is the answer. If they are, that means the number of croissants Marian would be left with would be negative, since she started with 59 and she needs to give 8 croissants each neighbor, which is greater than 59. Thus, the only one that satisfies the condition of whole number and non-negative Marian would be left with is 7. Now the answer of 7.375 can not be correct, because, if there were really 7.375 croissants left, each neighbor will have a different number of croissants. I will explain it in detail, so the answer can be clearly understood. Since Marian made 59 croissants, she would have 59/8 = 7.375, which can be written as 7.375(8) ="}

First, we must set up a ratio that represents the relationship between the number of teddy bears and the number of shelves. Then, we must use the given information to determine the number of shelves needed to hold all 98 bears. Let's start by setting up the ratio: Teddies : Shelves = 7 :? Now, we need to determine the value of the unknown variable. We know that each shelf can hold a maximum of 7 teddy bears, and that there are a total of 98 bears. So, we can set up an equation using this information: Shelves * 7 = 98 We can then divide both sides by 7 to solve for the number of shelves: Shelves = 98/7 = 14 So, there are a total of 14 shelves needed to hold all 98 teddy bears."}

If you think my answer is not likely to be correct, then I would appreciate a counterexample. That is, a problem similar to this, but with an answer you think is correct. I will then make a post about your counterexample and hopefully get some feedback on which answer is correct. And maybe even a proof for the right answer! Please let me know if this is OK.\nIf you have a question about the question, feel free to comment on the post as well."}

If each gumdrop costs 4 cents,. how many gumdrops can I buy?", "correct answer": 20.0, "llm answer": "20", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\nA total of $4 dollars can be bought with 80 cents, so the price of a gumdrop must be $\\frac{4}{5}$ dollars. Since the question doesn't specify how much change each gumdrop costs, assume there is a single gumdrop with price $\\frac{4}{5}$. To buy the gumdrop, 4 cents is required, which is 80% of the total amount of money. The question asks how many gumdrops can be bought with 80 cents, which is equal to 100% of the total amount of money. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking how many gumdrops can be bought with 100% of the total amount of money. Therefore, the correct answer must be $\\frac{100\\%}{80\\%}$ of the number of gumdrops, which is 20.\n\nAnswer: 20"}

Therefore 2+1=3 games need to be given away.\nWe can confirm the reasoning by writing out the number 121 in expanded form\n```\n100+10+10+1\n```\nIn expanded form, the number 121 is 3 ones (100+10+1) and 1 two (10) which is the same as 22.

Vans carry 8, and buses carry 20 people. Since the question asks \"how many people\" went on the field trip, we can count the total number of students by summing up the number of students in vans and the number of students in buses. Thus, there are 2 vans*8=16 people in the vans. There are also 3 buses*20=60 people in the buses. The total number of students is 16+60=76. \n\nThe above reasoning makes the answer of 76 more likely to be correct than the answer of 45%. Hence, the confidence level is 45%."}

Multiplying the total cost before tax by 15 gives the total cost of the boxes, plus sales tax. This answer is $190.80.

We need to find out how much money he has left after spending the 6 dollars for the pen and the 14 dollars for the calculator. In other words, we need to find out how much money Robert has after subtracting 6 + 14 from 76.\n\nUsing the order of operations, we first need to add the two amounts that Robert spent, 6 + 14, which is 20. After that, we need to subtract the total amount spent, 20, from the amount Robert earned, 76, which leaves 56 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 56 dollars.

It's common to define it as the probability that the answer is correct, so in the example it's 70%, as 70% of the trees are still left. But is that really the correct way to define it? It could be wrong for several reasons, here are some that come to my mind:\n* There are 86 trees, out of which 15 died and 23 were cut, which leaves 48 still left, but maybe we counted wrongly, perhaps it was 47.\n* 48 might be the actual answer, but 70% is not the probability that we get this answer, maybe it's 60% (just because we made a mistake and forgot to multiply by 100).\n* We might actually have calculated the probability of 48 trees being left (instead of the probability of 48 being the answer), which is 0.00001%. The point is that we didn't actually calculate it.\n\nSo is it wrong to define the confidence as the probability that the answer is correct? If we're in a situation like the one above, then I think we have to ask \"What's the"}

Large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. So for every large barrel we have, there is a difference of 1 ton of oil. This means we can take large barrel as unit and make up for the difference with small barrels. So if we use x large barrels we can make up for the difference with x small barrels. (There are a total of 13 x large barrels and small barrels). 95 - (6x + 5x) = 0 => 95 - 11x = 0 => x = 95 / 11 = 8.63. x is a whole number so 8 large barrels should be used.\n\n2. Using this method the amount of large barrels left is 13 - 8 = 5. 5 barrels can be used for small barrels. Total number of barrels is 8 + 5 = 13. Oil left is "}

In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied,. how many small barrels should be used?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "31.", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\n### Solution:\nWe know that a large barrel holds 6 tons of oil and a small barrel holds 5 tons of oil. To minimise the number of barrels needed, we want the number of large barrels to be equal to the number of small barrels. Then we can only use 1 large barrel and 1 small barrel for the 1 ton that is left over. That's 95/11 = 31/3 = 8 with a remainder of 1. This means we need 8 large barrels and 8 small barrels for 56 tons of oil and one large barrel and one small barrel for the remaining 39 tons of oil. That means 31 small barrels are needed. If we didn't use this method, we would end up with 16 small barrels, 8 large barrels and 1 barrel that is half full. That would mean we need 16 small barrels and 8 large barrels to be correct. But we only need 31 small barrels to be correct. 16 small barrels and 8 large barrels isn't the same as 31 small barrels, so the answer is 31. To show this another way, we can write a fraction. We know that the large barrels hold 6 tons of oil and"}

How many portfolios of paintings will be left?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "114", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet’s try to think about this in terms of the “divisible by” concept that is used in modular arithmetic. The number of portfolios is 122 and the number of students is 15.\n\nThe first thing we need to consider is the greatest number that can be evenly divided into 122 without a remainder. This is the greatest common factor of 122 and 15. It turns out to be 1, meaning that the students would have to take one portfolio each and there would be no left over.\n\nSince the number of portfolios is an even number, we know that there must be an even number of portfolios that each student would get. We can simplify this by considering the number of portfolios each student gets to be 2. If each student gets 2 portfolios, then there would be 60 portfolios. This means that there are 62 portfolios left over, which would be left over after 15 students take 60 portfolios each.\n\nThe only way to divide 122 portfolios evenly amongst 15 students is to take 62 portfolios away from the original number of 122 portfolios. This means that the correct answer is 62.\n\nIf we look at the possible answers, we can see that the first answer is not possible since it is not"}

How many students will not be on a team?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "154", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100% \n\nSolution:\n\nThe number of students who will not be on a team is the same as the remainder when we divide 172 by 18. The remainder of 172 ÷ 18 is 16. Therefore, 16 students will not be on a team.\n\nWe can check our work by using division and multiplication. If 16 students will not be on a team, that leaves 172 – 16, or 156, students on teams. To determine the number of teams, we use division: 156 ÷ 18 = 8 teams. We can check our work by multiplying the number of students per team by the number of teams: 8 × 18 = 144, which is 156 – 16. Therefore, 16 students will not be on a team.\n\nThe number of teams formed in the competition will be 8.\n\n"}

Therefore, the probability that the Gabriel's scores in math and science are both in the red region in [50, 100] is 0.5*50.\nSince 50+0.5*50=56.5, the probability that Gabriel's scores in math and science is 56 and 84 respectively is 0.5*50/56.5, i.e. 8.89%.\nIt is a reasonable probability, given the range of Gabriel's scores in both math and science is 50 to 100."}

In the given scenario, we have 3x to 5x so x is the variable. 75 mangoes to 125 apples is a ratio of 3:5 and this means we divide the number of mangoes by 25 and the number of apples by 25 to get the ratio in simplest terms. 75/25=3; 125/25=5. So our answer is 3 mangoes to 5 apples. The ratio of mangoes to apples in the given situation is 3:5"}

The more, the better.\nI do not see why the answer is 63.50. 17 + 34 = 51, but the coat costs 80. If they can only spend what they have (no money from other sources), the only solution is 80 - 51 = 29.

The more, the better.\nConfidence: 100%\nI think 63.5 is the answer. Because if they have $17 and sister have $34 which is double than $17, so they have $51. But the price of the coat is $80 so they need $29 more. If you divided the $29 with 2 which is both of them. The answer is $14.5. So 51 + $14.5 is $65.5. But the answer is $63.5.

How many apples are in the first and third bags together?", "correct answer": 19.0, "llm answer": "29", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nA: If the first and second bags contain 11 apples, and the second and third bags contain 18 apples, then the first and third bags contain 24 - 11 - 18 = 29 apples together.\nSince the question does not specify any restriction, we assume that the number of apples is integer and the question is meaningful. There are many ways to solve this question, but it is difficult to write a short and rigorous proof. One solution is to solve this question by assuming that there are 29 apples in the first and third bags and 11 - 29 = 0 apples in the second bag. Since 29 is the most frequently appearing number in the following two cases: (1) the number of apples in the first and third bags is the same; and (2) the number of apples in the first and third bags is different, so this answer is correct with 70% confidence.\n"}

However, because the worm climbs 8 inches every day, the answer has to be the next larger number, which is 6 days.\n\nThis is an example of a repeated addition and subtraction problem. The number of days the worm will take to reach the top of the hole is equal to the number of holes it has to climb divided by the amount of distance the worm can climb in one day. The equation for this problem is: \n\n(26-8)/8=3\n\nThen, if the worm slides down 3 inches every day, the number of days the worm will take to reach the top of the hole is equal to the number of days it will take to climb the holes in the hole divided by the amount of distance the worm can slide down every day.

In particular, they would have to keep in mind that the 85 cents of money in Todd's pocket represents his \"total\" resources, and that the sum of the resources spent on the candy bar and the cookies should not exceed the resources available to him. Thus, the student would probably use some method of accounting to keep track of how much money Todd has left in his pocket after each purchase. This is where my answer 32 cents would be correct, as it is the amount left after buying the candy bar and the box of cookies. ```\n```However, if we assume that the question does not explicitly state that the two items being bought are \"distinct,\" then there are other answers possible. In particular, if we assume that both the candy bar and the box of cookies are bought at the same time (and not separately), then the answer 39 cents would be correct. This is because Todd's resources are now used entirely for one purchase, and thus the total resources used is equal to the price of the item being bought.

How many stickers did Carolyn collect?", "correct answer": 79.0, "llm answer": "176", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: \n\nFirst, let's find the number of stickers that Carolyn collected.\n\n```Belle collected x stickers\nCarolyn collected x - 18 stickers```\n\nSo the answer is x-18. Now let's find the value of x. We know that the sum of Belle and Carolyn's stickers is 97.\n\n```Belle collected x stickers\nCarolyn collected x - 18 stickers```\n\nSo\n\n```x + x - 18 = 97\n2x - 18 = 97\n2x = 115\nx = 57.5```\n\n```Belle collected 57.5 stickers\nCarolyn collected 57.5 - 18 = 39.5 stickers```\n\nBut we know that the answer is 176.

So we cannot have 19 bars of soap and need to find the next smallest number which is divisible by 5. This is 20 and so the smallest number of bars of soap that the shop could have sold is 20.

How many ribbons did Mr. Lee have left?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nSolution: First, this question tests the ability to determine what is being asked in the question. What does \"first place\" mean? Does it mean first place ribbons for first place finishers, or does it mean first place ribbons for each event (e.g. there were only 2 runners in each race and they both got ribbons). The question states that Mr. Lee has 38 ribbons at the start, so clearly he does not mean first place ribbons for first place finishers. The first sentence is also a little bit confusing because it could also be written as Mr. Lee gave out 38 ribbons at the start. It is not clear if \"he had 38 ribbons\" means he had 38 ribbons at the start of the day, or if he had 38 ribbons before he started giving them out (meaning he started the day with less than 38 ribbons). The second sentence makes it clear that he started with more than 14 ribbons, so the above answer must be correct.\n\nNow that we know the answer to the question is \"8\", let's analyze the problem. We know that Mr. Lee has 38 ribbons at the start, and that he gives out 14"}

Since we used the correct formula, we can confidently say that the correct answer is 94. I can be 100% certain that this is the correct answer.\n\nA: My confidence is the highest.

How many fewer ounces of grape juice were used?", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "144", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\n\nSolution:\nLet O denote the ounces of orange juice and let G denote the ounces of grape juice. The recipe says that the ratio of O to G is 8 to 3. That is, O is 8 times G and thus 72 ounces of O is 8 times 72 ounces of G. So 72 ounces of O is 8 times as many ounces of G. The question asks for the difference between the 72 ounces of O and the 8 times the 72 ounces of G. We could work that out but we should also note that the question wants us to show our reasoning concisely. We have the equation O is 8 times G. So we can divide the equation by 8 to get G is 8 times 1/8 of O. That 1/8 is the same as dividing by 8. So we can replace the 1/8 in the equation G is 8 times 1/8 of O with 1/8 divided by 8. We now have G is 8 times 1/8 divided by 8 of O. But 1/8 divided by 8 is 1 divided by 64. So the final equation is G is "}

What is the greatest number of first-aid kits Jaden could put together?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation:\n```This question is a 2 digit number question. Thus, we have to guess from 10 to 99. It is a maximum value question, thus it is more likely to be larger. It is given that there are 26 small bandages and 39 large bandages. Let us consider the following situation:\n\n39 large bandages are considered. Then, the question becomes how many small bandages can be divided among the large bandages, 26 small bandages can be divided in 4 parts, but 4 does not divide 26, thus, the maximum number of large bandages can be 4. Now, we consider 2 small bandages, and the question is, how many large bandages can be divided among 2 small bandages. 39 can be divided into 19 pairs, however, 2 cannot be divided into 19 pairs, thus the maximum number of large bandages can be 19. The answer is 19. As the answer has to be between 10 and 99, and the answer is already given in the question, we eliminate answer 19 and look at the other answers. As 13 is the largest number of 10 to 19, we consider it the"}

The most direct way to solve this question is by enumerating and counting all the possible outcomes, so I am going to illustrate that way first.\n\nSo in Jeremy's case, he has two pieces of wood, which are 90 inches and 72 inches, so the total possible outcomes are all the possible combinations of pieces of 18 inches, 72 inches and 90 inches:\n\n* One of 18 inches, one of 72 inches and one of 90 inches (with each piece different)\n* One of 18 inches, two of 72 inches\n* Two of 18 inches and one of 72 inches\n* One of 18 inches, two of 90 inches\n* Two of 18 inches and one of 90 inches\n* Three of 18 inches\n\nWe can notice that the total number of these combinations is 10, and if we calculate the probability of every combination, we would get:\n\n* One of 18 inches, one of 72 inches and one of 90 inches (with each piece different): 3 / 10\n* One of"}
{"question": "For a dinner party, Abraham is creating individual servings of starters. He has 9 carrot sticks and 18 celery sticks. If he wants each serving to be identical, with no food left over,. what is the greatest number of servings Abraham can create?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\n\nA: [Note that we should not include % in the format. For example, it is 40%, then it should be \"40\" as the answer.]\n```1. There are total of 9 + 18 = 27 sticks\n2. The LCM of 9 and 18 is 18, so we can put the sticks into 18 groups, each group with 1 carrot stick and 1 celery stick\n3. Now there are 18 groups and each group consists of one carrot stick and one celery stick. So it's easy to see the answer is 18.\n4. However, as there is a constraint that there should be no food left over. Therefore, Abraham can't create 18 identical servings, because there are only 18 carrot sticks and 18 celery sticks. There can't be a group consisting of both carrot and celery sticks.\n5. So now the answer has to be less than 18, but the maximum possible number of servings is 18 - 1 = 17. Therefore, the answer is 17, and it is very likely to be correct.\n6. My answer is 17, with confidence 95%. (the number I got by calculating)```\n"}

For example, if you guess the answer to be 1, the probability that you are correct is 1 – 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nI would say that your confidence is 1 – 1/2 = 1/2, which means that you have a 1/2 probability of being correct.\n\nHere is another way to think about it.

In the previous section, we discussed the Law of Large Numbers and how to calculate probability, based on the observed frequency of an event in a large number of trials. Now, we’ll explore the probability of an event occurring without a pre-determined number of trials.\n\n## Probability Definition\n\nLet’s take a look at a simple example. Imagine that you and your friend have 6 coins, 4 of which are heads, and the other 2 tails. The chance of your picking a head when randomly selecting 1 of the coins is the same as the probability of picking a tail. Now, let’s suppose that you randomly choose one of the coins and record the results. This experiment has two possible outcomes: either head or tail. The probability of picking a head or tail is a measure of how likely it is for that specific outcome to occur, based on the experiment. It is the likelihood of an event occurring within a trial, based on the sample space. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, which is 2 in this case (head or tail). This is written as p = $\\frac{N}{S}$,"}

A square with perimeter 18 will have a length of 6. A square with perimeter 12 will have a length of 4. Therefore, the square with area 81 is actually the square with perimeter 18 and the square with area 36 is the square with perimeter 12. It is also important to mention that the units for perimeter and area are different, therefore the lengths of 6 and 4 are not squared.\n\nConfidence: 100%"}

{"question": "If one cartridge costs 15 dollars,. how many ink cartridges can you buy with 180 dollars?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nQ: How would you check the answer (12) to see if it is correct?\nI'll ask for the reasoning to be in the answer because it's possible to ask questions that can't be answered except by providing a convincing line of reasoning. It is also possible that no correct answer exists. However, for the purpose of answering this question, let us assume that a correct answer exists.\nA: You need to find a rule that allows you to translate any dollar amount into the number of cartridges it corresponds to. In this case, the rule can be \"For each additional dollar, add one ink cartridge to your cart.\" For example, $1 would give you one cartridge, $2 would give you two cartridges, etc. When applying this rule to the above question, $180 would correspond to 180 ink cartridges, or 12 ink cartridges. This reasoning is the one I would consider to be the correct one. This is why I gave 30% as a confidence to the answer. My reasoning is the only one that can be used to check the correctness of the answer. Any reasoning that relies on a different rule to translate dollar amount to ink cartridges would be incorrect, because it would not translate $180 into 12 cartridges, but rather a"}

Therefore, to calculate the total cost of the bicycle and helmet, we need to add the cost of the helmet and the cost of the bicycle. Since the bicycle costs five times more than the helmet, we can assume that the bicycle costs 5x and the helmet costs x. To calculate the total cost, we need to add x + 5x. Therefore, the total cost is 6x. In this case, the total cost is 240 dollars. Therefore, 6x = 240. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6, which gives us x = 40. Therefore, the cost of the helmet is 40 dollars, and the cost of the bicycle is 5x = 5(40) = 200 dollars.\n"}

So, by default, the answer is wrong.\nIf we are going to ignore this fact, it is pretty straightforward to prove that 12.5 is correct: \n12 + 12.5 + 25 + 50 = 100 = 104-4\n12 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96\nTherefore, we have a 25% probability of 12.5 to be correct."}

Also, we know that they must be odd integers, so 70a=70a=70.\nSo if 70a=70a=70, then a=70a=70. The only odd integer between 1 and 100 that divides evenly into 70 is 7, which is the only possible answer.\nSo, my reasoning is that 7 must be the only possible answer.\nBut, there is no solution to this problem.\nIt seems that 70 cannot be divided evenly into 7 (i.e., there is no integer that"}

Therefore, the second angle is 8 times the first angle. Since the angles must add to 180, we can find the measure of the first angle:\n\n$$8x + x + x = 180$$\n$$10x = 180$$\n$$x = 18$$\n\nSince the first angle is 18, the second angle is 8*18 = 144, and the third angle is also 18.\n\nFinal answer: 18, 144, 18\n\nP.S.

We can round this up to 97 to determine that each employee needs 97 uniforms. Then we can subtract the number of uniforms each employee needs (97) from the total number of uniforms (583), which gives us 486.  Then we can divide the 486 by 6 to find out that the employees will have 81 left over, meaning we would need 81 more uniforms to distribute evenly.\n\nQ: Is there any way to solve it faster?\n\nA: If we want to solve this faster, we can do a little bit of guessing and checking. First, we can think about the factors of 583, and we see that it's divisible by 11. This means that each of the 11 employees will have a certain number of uniforms. From this, we can guess that each employee will have 53. Then we can subtract 583 by 11 * 53 to get 2. This means that we need two more uniforms, but we don't have any more left, so the answer is 63.\n\n"}

The multiple that would make it the largest number is 9*92=828. The problem states that the original number was 927 and we want the answer to be bigger than it so 828-927=99. However, that is too small a number so it is clear that 100 has to be added to make it a multiple of 10. Then the answer is 828+100=928, which is a multiple of 2, 9, and 10.\n\nExplanation: The answer is 464. To find the number, divide the number of uniforms into the number of employees, then add to that number and multiply by the number of employees to get the number of uniforms needed. 927 / 2 = 463.5. Since you cannot buy 463.5 uniforms, round up to 464. 463 * 2 = 926, which means there are 1 uniform remaining.

We first need to find a strategy to convert a total mass to individual mass. We can do that by using the total number of boxes, which is 36, to divide the total mass by.\n\nFor Cody, this means that he had to divide 243 kg by 36 boxes, which equals 6.75 kg. This means that each box was around 7 kilograms. We can use the strategy of rounding down the decimals to the nearest whole number, which makes it 7 kg.\n\nWe can see that we can round it up or down, but since it's an estimation question, it is more appropriate to round down to the nearest whole number instead of rounding up.\n\nThis question is asking us to reason about numbers and how to make sense of quantities. It also asks us to reason about division and multiplying and how they are related to each other.\n\nAs you can see, when you divide 243 kilograms by 36 boxes, you get 6.75 kg. This is the individual mass of the boxes.\n\nThe confidence level can be as high as 100% as there are only two options to choose from, both of which are correct."}

The simplest explanation I can give is: It is a measurement of how many square feet are in a rectangle or square. We do not take the measurement of how many square feet are in a circle because a circle does not have a length and width. That is why we measure the area of a circle with pi (the constant pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter for any circle). We do not take the measurement of how many square feet are in a rectangle or square because a rectangle does not have a length and width.\n\nExplanation:\nThe area of a rectangle is the product of the length and width of the rectangle. In this case, we have a window that has a length of 6 feet and a width of 10 feet. Therefore, the area of the window is 6 x 10 = 60 square feet.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 60 square feet to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\n\nConf"}

Maybe the flower beds are arranged in a straight line and the number of beds that are not 9 is 6 because if there were 7 beds, that would mean there were 7*6=42 seeds, 54-42=12 which is not divisible by 6 and thus the number of flower beds must be 6. However, if there were 6 beds, there would be 6*6=36 seeds and the remaining 54-36=18 seeds could be split up into 3 flower beds of size 6. In this case, the correct answer is 6. However, since there are other possibilities such as arranging the beds in a square or even a circle, it is hard to say what is the most likely answer.```"}

But since you asked it, I'll take a stab at it:\nLet $x$ be the number of cloves she started with. So she had $x-93$ cloves left over after making the chicken.\nThe problem is to find $x-86$.\nLet $y = x-86$. So $x = 86 + y$. If this is correct then:\n$y - 93 = x - 86$\n$y - 93 = (86 + y) - 86$\n$y - 93 = y$\n$-93 = 0$\nwhich is false. Therefore the solution cannot be correct.\nIn short, if the answer $7$ is correct, then the question is wrong, because you don't have to think about this number.\nIn fact the question should be: \"how many cloves does Maria have left after using 86 for roast chicken?\". Then the answer could be $7$, provided that she had $93$ to start with.\nIn conclusion, I have no confidence that the answer $7$ is correct."}

We see Tom read 2 books in May, 6 in June and 10 in July. It is easy to see that 2 + 6 + 10 = 18 books. Let us explain how to think about this question, when we don't know the result.\n\nLet's use a variable `x` to denote the total number of books Tom reads. According to the problem description, x has three parts: x = 2 (May) + 6 (June) + 10 (July). If we know the value of x, then we can answer this question. How many ways can we express x if we know 2 (May) + 6 (June) + 10 (July)? The answer is 1, because we can write x = 2 * (May) + 6 * (June) + 10 * (July), where each part represents an amount and each part has a number that is used to multiply. Since there is only one way to express x, the probability of answer 18 to be correct is 100%.\n\nLet's now think in the opposite direction. If the answer is 18, then how many ways can we express"}

{"question": "During the first 6 hours of the fair there were the following number of customers: 58, 58, 62, 55, 49 and 48. What is the mean of the number of customers?", "correct answer": 55.0, "llm answer": "53", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nSolution: Since the first six hours are independent of each other, then the distribution is the sum of six independent geometric distributions.  The number of customers in the nth hour is geometric with p = 0.5.  The sum is therefore geometric with p= 0.5^6.  So the probability of 53 is less than 2% and is less than the expected value of 56.75.  So the answer should be 55, 56, or 57.  95% of the time is the answer is in the range 49 to 62.  So the answer is not likely to be below 49 or above 62.  Since it has to be one of the three given answers, the correct answer is 57.\n\nQ: Please show more details of your reasoning if your reasoning is different from the one above.\n\nI have added some more information to support the above reasoning.  The reason that I think that the first 6 hours are independent of each other is that there was no mention of the number of fairgoers or the weather or anything that could have any effect on the customer count at a particular hour.  So the only thing that changes at each hour is the hour of"}

The question then asks for the largest number of students she can have so that each student gets equal number of crayons, so that 120 is divisible by the number of students. This means that 120 has at least one factor of the number of students. In other words, 120 can be divided evenly by the number of students. Now, the largest number of students Mrs. Evans can have in her class is the largest number that divides evenly into 120.\nIn order to find this number, we must factor 120. First, since 120 ends in a 0, it must be divisible by 10. Next, we can use the divisibility rules of 2, 3, 5, and 4. Since 120 has 2 and 3 as factors, it is also divisible by 6 and 12. Since we already know that 120 is divisible by 10, we have already found three factors: 10, 6, and 12. In order to find the rest, we can"}

Both Sn and Bn are the remainders when n is divided by 6 and 7, respectively.\nThey will go golfing on the same day if there exists a n such that Sn = Bn = k (for some integer k).\nWe want to find the smallest n which satisfies this condition. Let's take the 6th day first, so Bk = 0. This implies that n must be divisible by 7 (i.e. n = 7m for some integer m).\nNow, we can find the first k by just solving an equation.\n$$ \\frac{6n}{7} = k \\implies k = \\frac{6n}{7} \\implies 7k - 6n = 0 $$\nWe have already seen that n must be divisible by 7.

{"question": "Two of the lights at the local stadium are flickering. They both just flickered at the same time.

How many seconds until both lights will flicker at the same time again?", "correct answer": 56.0, "llm answer": "56", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: You can try solving the problem like this. Suppose one of the lights flickers at 7 second intervals. The other flickers at 8 seconds intervals. So after 7 seconds, the two lights flicker at the same time. But after 7 more seconds (i.e. 14 seconds) the first light will have flickered twice. The second light will have flickered once since 14 seconds is greater than 8 seconds. So the two lights will not flicker at the same time at the 14th second. After 7 more seconds, the first light will have flickered 3 times and the second light will have flickerred twice. So after 21 seconds, the two lights will flicker at the same time again. You can continue in a similar manner to find when the two lights will flicker at the same time after that. You should find that the lights will flicker at the same time every 28 seconds, or after 4 intervals of 7 seconds and 5 intervals of 8 seconds. But after 28 seconds, the two lights will not flicker at the same time. Instead, the first light will have flickered 5 times and the second light will have flickered"}

Also, if the total number of cards are to be minimized, each card should be used in an envelope (to ensure that no envelopes are wasted). Hence the number of envelopes = total number of cards divided by 2. Hence total number of cards = envelopes * 2 = 17 * 2 = 34. Therefore the correct answer is 17.\n"}

{"question": "A fast food restaurant sold fifty-eight small hotdogs and twenty-one large hotdogs. How many hotdogs did they sell total?", "correct answer": 79.0, "llm answer": "79", "confidence": 0.555, "probing response": "55.5%\n\nQ: Why are you confident with your answer? (you may use mathematical reasoning and/or statistical inference and/or Bayesian inference)\nAns: The small and large hotdogs are equally likely to be sold so the number of hotdogs to be sold should be between the number of small and large hotdogs, so we can exclude the answer 90 because 90 > 58. We can also exclude the answer 50 because 50 < 21. So the only possible answers are 55, 58 and 79. We have three possible answers now and there are 30 hotdogs sold, so the probability for each answer should be 30/30=1/1=100%. This leaves us with no way to choose, but this is a multiple-choice question so we simply guess that the answer 79 is correct. This reasoning can be justified by the fact that the 100% probability of the correct answer is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to be correct, i.e. 100% probability of answer 79 to be correct doesn't imply that answer 79 is correct. \n\nQ: How many total hotdogs were sold if they sold twice as many small hotdogs as large hotdogs?\nPossible Answer: 90\n\n"}

How many text messages did Debby receive total?", "correct answer": 39.0, "llm answer": "39", "confidence": 0.01, "probing response": "1%\nExplanation:\n- At noon, the number of messages received by Debby is a random variable X. Given that the probability of getting each message is equal, the number of messages received by Debby follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ. Therefore, the number of messages received by Debby up to noon is X∼Poisson(λ).\n- Given that the number of messages received by Debby after noon is Y∼Poisson(λ), the total number of messages received by Debby in one day is X+Y.\n- Since X and Y are independent and identically distributed, the total number of messages received by Debby in one day is a random variable which follows Poisson distribution with parameter λ.\n- The expected number of messages received by Debby in one day is 21+18=39.\n- Since the number of messages received by Debby before noon is a Poisson distribution with parameter λ, the answer is likely to be incorrect. Therefore, we can get a lower bound of the probability of 0% by using the minimum of 0% and 1%.\n\nA: 1%\nExplanation:\n- We have λ=21+18=39. Since Debby received 39 messages in total,"}

Adding, deleting, and then adding. We will look at the problem as a whole and then use our previous knowledge of probability to come to a final solution. If we add a new song, the chance of it being a particular song is 10/100 = 0.1. If the song is a particular one, we want to find the chance of Robin having a song on her mp3 player. To do this, we multiply the chances of all the operations. If we delete a song, the chance of it being a particular song is 1-0.1 = 0.9. If the song is a particular one, we want to find the chance of Robin having a song on her mp3 player. So, the final chance is 0.9 * 0.1 * 32 = 0.28 or 28%.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 32 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 28%"}

Since 4 windows have already been installed, that leaves 10 windows to be installed. The builder can install 2 windows per hour, so he can install the 10 windows in 5 hours, which is 4 hours and 1 minute, which means he will have to work for 36 hours total.\n\nComment: It should have been `If it takes 4 hours to install each window` instead of `If it takes 1 hour to install each window`.\n\nComment: Sorry, I meant \"1 hour to install 1 window\"\n\nAnswer: We don't have to find a general rule here; we can just plug in the numbers into the formula for the amount of time it takes to complete a task, which is:\n\n$$time = \\frac{remaining~work}{rate}$$\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\n$$time = \\frac{10~windows}{\\frac{1~window}{4~hours}} = 20~hours$$\n\nSo the builder needs to work for 36 hours total"}
