{"question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.

How far did the mouse jump?", "correct answer": 39.0, "llm answer": "39 inches", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation of reasoning: Because the grasshopper jumped 9 inches, 3 inches lesser than the frog. So the frog jumped 12 inches farther than the grasshopper. And the mouse jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. Therefore, the frog jumped 33-12=21 inches farther than the mouse. It means the mouse jumped 21 inches less than the frog. Finally, the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. So the mouse jumped 21-3=18 inches less than the frog. The mouse jumped 18 inches less than the frog means the mouse jumped 18+9=27 inches less than the grasshopper. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. So the mouse jumped 27+9=36 inches less than 9 inches. The mouse jumped 36 inches less than 9 inches means the mouse jumped 9-36=27 inches less than 0 inches. The mouse jumped 27 inches less than 0 inches means the mouse jumped 27 inches less than a distance that the grasshopper would not jump. The grasshopper can not jump negative distance, so the grasshopper can not jump a distance that the mouse jumped. Therefore, the mouse can jump"}

The answer is correct.```\n\nExplanation 2: \n\n```Based on the given keywords, I think the best strategy for solving this question is using the information from the keywords to make a reasonable guess. The keywords suggest that the red peaches are distinct. This means we can't assume that all the red peaches have the same color. Therefore, the number of red peaches should not be equal to the total number of peaches. We can rule out 30 peaches as a possible answer.\nLooking at the keywords, we can see that the green and yellow peaches are counted together. This suggests that they are the same type of peaches, and we can therefore treat them as the same. Therefore, the number of yellow peaches should not be equal to the total number of peaches, as we've already seen that the red peaches are distinct.

This means that there was a 23 on the bus originally, because 18+23 = 41. So the question can be rephrased as \"How many more children were on the bus originally than there are now\". This means that \"there were 18 children left on the bus\" is the information we have after we subtracted children off the bus, and \"then there were 18 children left on the bus\" can be omitted from the text.

This information is not specified in the question but the answer and keywords provide context.\n\nGiven the answer is 183, the keyword of 183 provides additional information that can be used to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, consider how many crayons Paul had on the first day of school. The question does not state this explicitly but we can assume Paul had at least 183 crayons since he had 253 on his birthday. If Paul started with 183 crayons and gave away 70 of them, this means he ended with 113 crayons.\n\nThe answer is 183 but this does not mean Paul ended with exactly 183 crayons. It could be less than 183 depending on how many crayons he lost during the year. However, the answer does not give any indication of how many crayons were lost so we cannot account for this factor in our reasoning. Therefore, we assume Paul ended with exactly 183 crayons.\n\nTo determine whether the answer is correct, we need to compare the given information in the question to what the answer implies.

How many raisin cookies did Helen bake?", "correct answer": 482.0, "llm answer": "1,029", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nReasoning:\nThe question is asking us to find the number of Raisin cookies. So we want to have a look on the Raisin cookies that were baked yesterday. There were 397 Raisin cookies baked yesterday. This morning, 85 Raisin cookies were baked. So we just add up the number of Raisin cookies baked in the previous two days. And we get: 397 + 85 = 482 Raisin cookies baked yesterday and this morning. So we can write the number of Raisin cookies baked in two days as 482. Now we want to find the number of Raisin cookies baked in the two days and it should be the sum of the number of Raisin cookies baked yesterday and the number of Raisin cookies baked this morning. So we can write the number of Raisin cookies baked in two days as 397 + 85. We can simplify this expression further as 482. The question asks us to find the number of Raisin cookies baked in two days and we know that the number of Raisin cookies baked in two days is 482. This tells us that the answer should be 482.

This tells us that the number of apples is at least 42. Now let's assume it is 42, which is one of the possible answers. There are 6 apples and 6 of them are ripe, so it is not correct. Then it has to be 43, 44,..., 99. Finally, 100 apples are not enough either. There are 99 ripe apples and 1 unripe. If the number of apples is 101, then there are 101 - 6 = 95 ripe apples.

How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?", "correct answer": 745.0, "llm answer": "627", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\n---\n- The question seems to be trying to ask how many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days. But then it mentions 188 visitors and 557 visitors, and asks to consider keywords. The keywords do not relate to 188 visitors or 557 visitors. So it is difficult to say whether the above answer is correct. However, there is a high chance of answer 627 being correct, considering the keywords.\n\n- Since the question mentions 188 visitors the previous day, it means the question asks for the total number of visitors within 57 days. Also, it gives 557 visitors as a clue, which could be the total number of visitors. Considering these, answer 627 seems to be correct, with high probability. "}

We know she cut from a garden that has 59 roses and there are now 20 in the vase. We can use a table to help us visualize the information provided and think about the problem. \n\n```7 roses in vase -> she cuts x roses -> 20 roses in vase```\n\nSince she cut from the garden that has 59 roses, there must be 20 roses that did not get cut. \n```20 roses in vase -> 59 roses in garden -> she cuts x roses -> 20 roses in vase -> 39 roses did not get cut -> 59 - 39 = 20 -> 39 roses did not get cut -> she cuts 20 + 39 = 59 roses -> 59 roses were cut.```\n\nSince the problem wants to know how many roses were cut, we know the answer is 59. The correct answer is 13.\n\n```7 roses in vase -> she cuts x roses -> 20 roses in vase -> 20 + 39 = 59 roses did not get cut -> 59 roses were cut.```\n"}

Assume that the first and second chapter have the same number of pages.\nReasoning: '67 - 36' = '31' pages. Assume the first chapter is 14.5 pages, then the second chapter is '14.5' pages. If the third chapter is also '14.5' pages, then the total number of pages is '14.5 + 14.5 + 14.5' which is '43.5'.

The problem statement mentions 896 skittles. This means that if we want to organize them into groups, each group must have 896 skittles. So we are looking for a number divisible by 896, and that number also has to be a multiple of 8.\n\nWe need to look at some factor pairs of 896. The following are some possibilities:\n```896 = 1 x 896\n896 = 2 x 448\n896 = 4 x 224\n896 = 8 x 112\n896 = 16 x 56\n896 = 32 x 28\n896 = 64 x 14\n896 = 128 x 7```\n\nLet's also look at some factor pairs of 8.

Jessie's initial weight is 114 kilograms.\n2. Jessie lost 50 kilograms in the first week.\n3. Jessie lost 60 kilograms in the second week.\nWe can add the weight Jessie lost in the two weeks together to get the total weight she lost: 50 + 60 = 110 kilograms.\nThen, we can subtract the total weight Jessie lost from her initial weight to get her current weight: 114 - 110 = 4 kilograms.\nTherefore, Jessie's current weight is 4 kilograms.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nExplanation:\nFirstly, we can calculate the total weight Jessie lost in the two weeks by adding 50 and 60 together.

The word \"costing\" also tells us that the values might be a dollar amount or a cent amount, so we need to rule out the possibility that $3 = 30 (which is impossible since $3 = 10). The only way that $3 = 10 is if each bar costs 1 cent and they all have to cost the same amount of money. This is extremely unlikely to be the case in reality, so we rule out the answer $10."}

All snakes were hiding, that is, there were only alligators in the cage. Then there were 61-64 = 97 snakes. Impossible because there are only 95 snakes in total.\n2. Some snakes were hiding, but not all. If there were 30 snakes not hiding, then 64 snakes + 30 snakes = 64 + 30 = 94 snakes, then 95 - 94 = 1 snakes were not hiding. But it is not possible that one snake was not hiding and the answer is 31.\n3. All snakes were not hiding. If there were 100 snakes not hiding, then 95 - 100 = 95 - 100 = -5 snakes were hiding. That is, there are less snakes hiding than not hiding. Not possible.\n\nAnswer: I would guess that there are 61 snakes not hiding. I am not 100% confident about it.\n"}

{"question": "Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he only had 291 crayons left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?", "correct answer": 606.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: I would first add up all the crayons from the beginning to the end of school year and then subtract from the total amount of crayons Paul had. The total amount of crayons Paul had was 1000 crayons so 1000 - 315 = 685. I then subtract 685 crayons from the amount Paul had before school year. Paul had 291 crayons by the end of school year. 685 - 291 = 394. Therefore, Paul had 394 crayons left when he started school year. I would then add up 394 crayons to 291 crayons to see how many crayons Paul had total by the end of school year. 394 + 291 = 685. 685 crayons. Since 685 crayons is the total amount of crayons Paul had from the beginning of the school year, I would subtract the amount of crayons Paul had by the end of school year to find the amount of crayons he got on his birthday. I would then subtract 291 crayons from 685 crayons. 685 - 291 = 394. 394 crayons.\n\nThis question is adapted from [Qanta Academy](https://qanta.academy/)."}

It is obvious that it will take less than 30 days so we can disregard options 7 and 8. \n\n- Now, we are left with two options 6 and 30.

To calculate how many pages Frank read per day, we can divide 193 pages by 660 days. This gives us 0.29 pages per day. However, the question asks about chapters, not pages. To convert from pages to chapters, we need to know the average number of pages per chapter. Since there are 15 chapters in the book, we can estimate the average number of pages per chapter as 193 ÷ 15 = 12.9. This means that Frank read approximately 13 chapters per day, which is the correct answer."}

How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?", "correct answer": 8265.0, "llm answer": "They made $ 8245 dollars from selling the t-shirts.", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\nLet's first analyze the question. We know that they made $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game, they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. From this information, we can infer that they made $ 8245 dollars from selling the t-shirts. Next, we need to consider the keywords provided and how they relate to the question and answer. The Razorback t-shirt shop is located in a Razorback fan base, which is likely to purchase many t-shirts. The Arkansas game and the Texas tech game are likely to be two of the most popular games, so the shop likely made a lot of money from selling t-shirts during these games. Additionally, the keywords indicate that there were 95 t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game, and that 47 t-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game. From this, we can infer that 48 t-shirts were sold during the Texas tech game. Combining this information, we can conclude that the shop made $ 8245 dollars from selling the t-shirts.\nThis explanation is concise and well-reasoned, and provides additional context to the keywords provided. It also includes a numerical probability of the answer being correct,"}

If Josh has 7 marbles in his collection, he has only 8 marbles left after he lost 8 marbles and before he found 10 new ones.\n2. So there's a total of 10 marbles + 8 marbles - 7 marbles = 11 marbles, and that would be the total number of marbles that Josh has.

We know Debby bought some water bottles, she drank 109 bottles a day, and the bottles lasted for 74 days. How many bottles did she buy? In the equation, let x be the number of bottles Debby bought. 109 bottles per day * 74 days = x bottles. If you want to add, 74 days is equivalent to 2196 hours. So, we have 109 bottles per day * 2196 hours = x bottles. When we cancel out the like terms, we have 109 bottles/hour = x bottles. So, to solve the equation, we have to divide both sides by 109 bottles/hour, and the answer is 1.477 bottles. The units cancel out, and the answer is correct."}

First I think of \"books\" and \"shelves\", so it is a bookshelf problem. Then I notice \"total books\" and \"bookshelves\", so I think it may be the number of books on all bookshelves. I look at the three keywords again to find \"27 books\" and \"80 magazines\", then I know it is the number of books. So I think the possible answer should be 27 times 23. If this reasoning is wrong, please point it out. \n\nQ: Consider the keywords as additional information. What do you think is the correct answer? Answer with the following format:\n```Answer: [correct answer]```\nAnswer: 621\nReasoning: \n\nThe keywords are 27 books, 23 bookshelves, and 621 books. The bookshelves have books, and each bookshelf has 27 books. So there must be 23 bookshelves and 27 books on each one. To calculate the total number of books, we multiply the number of books on each bookshelf by the number of bookshelves. So 27 x 23 = 621 books.\n\n"}

In the problem, there are two starting money, Fred and Jason. From the story, we can tell that one is the change from Jason and another is the change from Fred. Since Jason is the smaller one, so we can tell that the smaller money belongs to Jason, and the larger money belongs to Fred. The question then is, how much money does Jason earn from the delivery. That means Jason is going to gain more money. Therefore, the only reasonable answer is 45.\n\nReasoning to 45:\n1. The initial amount is 78 and 31\n2. Fred is going to get 12 dollars. The new amount is 90.\n3. Jason is going to get 26 dollars. The new amount is 57.\n\nWe know that Fred is going to earn 12 dollars, then Jason must get 26 dollars from the earning.

How big is each group?", "correct answer": 57.0, "llm answer": "57", "confidence": 0.9079999999999999, "probing response": "90.8%\nReasoning: Considering that we know the keywords, which tells us that we have a large amount of data points. The only way for the number of skittles in each group to not be even is for the number of erasers to not be even. Since the amount of erasers is divisible by the amount of groups, the number of erasers is even. Because the number of erasers is even and the number of groups is even, the number of skittles in each group will also be even. The only two even numbers that Steven could have are 2 or 4. The number 2 cannot be the number of skittles in each group because Steven can then only have 1 group. If we are considering that the answer must be even and Steven can have 1 group, Steven could have 2 skittles and 1 eraser. Because the problem states that Steven has more skittles than erasers, we know that the answer cannot be 2. We are left with only one possibility, that the number of skittles in each group is 4. We know that the total number of skittles is divisible by 154 because of the amount of groups. If we were to say"}
