The reasoning is that there is no way the answer is not 3.\nBut if I read and watch with the same ratio, the number of books and movies will be similar, the ratio between movies and books are not necessary 19:16. For instance, the movie \"crazy silly school\" will have the same book \"crazy silly school\" in every movie series, so that ratio is not necessarily 19:16.

The question is about the additional number of orchids compared to the roses. The additional number of orchids compared to the roses is 13-9=4. The additional number of orchids compared to the roses is 10-3=7. The additional number of orchids compared to the roses is 16-15=1.

{"question": "After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 317 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day.

How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nAnswer: \nExplanation: Let `X` be the number of visitors to the palace the previous day, and `Y` be the number of visitors the day we visited the palace. The only information we have is that `Y=317` and `X=295`, and from that, we want to find the difference between `Y` and `X`.\n\nIt would be better to try the answer options first. If we try the answer option, we get a difference of 22 people. So, let's use the numbers `X=295` and `Y=317` to see if they're in line with this. That would mean that `Y-X` is `22`.\n\nIf we subtract `295` from `317`, then we get `22` as the answer. It looks like this answer choice is correct!\n\nAnother way of doing this problem could be using our knowledge about absolute values and the fact that the difference between any two numbers is equal to the absolute value of the first number minus the absolute value of the second number. Since we know that `X=295` and `Y=317`, then we can calculate the absolute values for both numbers: `abs(X)=295`, `abs(Y)=317`.\n\nUsing these numbers"}

Since they actually had 61 bottles of diet soda, we can subtract 61 - 22 = 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.\n\n---\n\n**Possible Explanation:**\nIn order to answer this question, we need to first know how many bottles of regular soda there are in total. If we subtract the number of bottles of regular soda from the total number of bottles, we will get the number of bottles of diet soda. If we then add the number of bottles of regular soda to the result, we will get the total number of bottles. For this question, there are 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda. We need to subtract 22 from 61 to get the number of bottles of diet soda. 61 - 22 = 39. Therefore, there are 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.\n"}

If he picked 134 of them yesterday and 30 today. How many will he have left after today?\"\nIt also seems like the question is not asking for the current number of tomatoes the farmer has, but rather for the number he will have left after picking today.\nSince we know how many he picked yesterday (134), we know how many he will have after yesterday (171 - 134 = 37).\nSo, we know he will have 37 after yesterday, but he picked 30 more today, which means he will have 37 + 30 = 67 after today.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 67.\nI'm 100% confident that this is the correct answer.\n"}

{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "1258", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation:\n- First, we can see that the bus can hold a maximum of 58 students at any one time. Since there are 87 classrooms, we can assume that there are 58 students in each classroom.\n- Second, we know that there are 2517 seats in the school buses. To divide 2517 seats by 58, we need to find out how many times 58 goes into 2517. 58 goes into 2517 43 times with a remainder of 19. Therefore, 2517 is 43 times larger than 58. 2517/58=43 remainder 19\n- Finally, we need to know how many buses it would take to get all 2517 students on the bus. Since each bus can only hold 58 students, and we already know that 2517 is 43 times larger than 58, then we can multiply 43 times 58 to get 2517. 43 x 58 = 2517. Therefore, it would take 43 buses to get all 2517 students on the bus. 2517 is 43 times larger than 58. \n\nTherefore, 2517/58 = 43. Therefore, 43 is"}

How many apples did Rachel pick in all?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "84", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```I think the answer is 84 because I found that there are a total 29 apples still on the trees. The 7 apples are from each tree, 4 trees in total. 7×4=28. 29 apples still on the trees, subtract 28, we get 1 apple.

Therefore, we need to subtract B from 86. This is because we are given 86 bird families that have flown away for the winter, so we need to subtract the number that have stayed behind from 86.\n\nSo, to get the number of bird families that have flown away for the winter, we would subtract B from 86.

The statement says every day Ryan spends 2 hours on learning english, 5 hours on learning chinese and 4 hours on learning spanish. I don't know if the author means the total hours of learning the languages every day, or the average hours of learning the languages every day. But if it's the total hours, the total hours must be 11 for 3 languages, so the number of hours he spends on learning chinese than he does on learning spanish must be 5-4=1. If it's the average hours, the average hours must be 11/3=3.66, so the number of hours he spends on learning chinese than he does on learning spanish must be 5-4=1, which means the hours he spends on learning chinese is higher than the hours he spends on learning spanish, that is the reason why we choose the answer that says 1 more hour.\n2.

First, we notice that the 19 different books and the 62 movies, both are multiples of 19. So we know that each book has 4 movies and each movie has 4 books, making the total books and movies to 4*19=76. Now, we also have information that 4 books were read and 34 movies were watched. The question asks, how many books are left? \nIf we take this in a concrete way, we get: \n```\n(34 books + 4 books watched)*4movies - (4 books watched * 4 movies watched)\n```\nOr, \n```\n(38 books watched)*4movies - (4 books watched * 4 movies watched)\n```\nWhich will be same as, \n```\n152 movies watched - 16 movies watched\n```\nWhich is same as, \n```\n136 movies watched\n```\nNow, since we know that the total movies are 62, we have a problem in our hands:\n```\n62 movies = 136 movies watched\n```\nWhich will be, \n```\n62 movies = (19"}

How many minutes did the machine work yesterday?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "44", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: This is a simple arithmetic question, where we know 9 shirts is 3 minutes. So if the machine has worked for an additional 44 minutes, it should have produced another 44 shirts. \n\nPossible alternative answer is 0. This is not correct, since it means the machine has stopped for one day. Another alternative answer is 72 shirts, which is the number of shirts made in total. This is correct but not the one we are looking for. There is no other number between 44 and 72 shirts that is a multiple of 3.\n\nThe problem can be reformulated as a multiplication question. How many minutes it takes to make 9 shirts (x) times the number of additional minutes it takes to make 44 shirts (x+44). This is the same as x*(x+44)=3*44=132, which gives us x=3, since x is a multiple of 3."}

If her room is 2 feet wide, we have to find the length of her room. To find the length of the room, we can use the formula for area of a rectangle, which is length x width. So, to find the length of the room, we need to divide the area by the width. In this case, we are given the area as 10 square feet and the width as 2 feet, so we can plug these values into the formula as follows: length = area / width length = 10 square feet / 2 feet length = 5 feet So, the correct answer is 5 feet.\n\nNote that in this question, it is important to be careful with units, as different units for length and width would result in different answers. For example, if we were given the area as 10 square feet and the width as 2 inches, then the length would be 50 inches, which is different from the correct answer of 5 feet. Similarly, if we were given the area as 10 square feet and the width as 2 meters, then the length would be"}

The number of boys is given by \"841\", which is positive and greater than the number of girls, which is given by \"34\". The answer is calculated by subtracting the absolute value of \"34\" from \"841\". The absolute value of \"34\" is \"34\" itself since it is positive.

How many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nIn this problem, we can reason as follows.\n\nTo eat 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies, Paco must have had at least 23 + 32 = 55 cookies. Paco started with 39 + 6 = 45 cookies, so he must have eaten at least 55 - 45 = 10 cookies. But we already know he ate 23 salty cookies, so he must have eaten the remaining 10 - 23 = -13 salty cookies. Then we can solve the problem with the following equations:\nx = total cookies Paco ate after eating 23 salty cookies;\ny = number of sweet cookies Paco ate after eating 23 salty cookies.\nx = 23 + y\ny = 39 - x\nThese equations can be solved for x and y by adding the first equation to 2 times the second and then by solving for y. The results are x = -24 and y = 63, which shows Paco ate 63 - 39 = 24 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.\n"}

How many roses are there in the vase now?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "18", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\n## Background of the question\nThis question is related to a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04802.pdf) about using pre-trained language models to assess the quality of explanations.\n\n## Solution and analysis\n### How to solve\nThe key to solve this problem is to focus on the important information that the problem is asking for: the current amount of roses in the vase.\nBy ignoring the other pieces of information such as the roses that Jessica has cut and how many roses there are in the vase, we can conclude that the current amount of roses in the vase must be 10+8=18. This reasoning process is based on the assumption that Jessica has not cut the roses before, but rather she has added 8 roses to the vase. It is important to note that this assumption is not necessarily correct in all cases, as it may be possible that Jessica has already cut the roses before and then added them back to the vase. However, by making this assumption, we can conclude that the correct answer is indeed 18.\n\n### Reasoning process\nThe problem is to reason about the number of roses in the vase after Jessica adds 8 more roses. To solve this problem, we can use the following reasoning process:\n\n1"}

Then he ate 36 more. If Bobby ate 74 pieces of candy. And also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. 74 pieces of candy - 16 pieces of chocolate = 58 pieces of candy - chocolate. So he ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate. And 58 is the answer.\n\nAnswer: The question asks for how many more pieces of candy than chocolate Bobby ate, so the possible answer should be the difference between the number of pieces of candy and the number of pieces of chocolate. By looking at the keywords, we can infer that Bobby ate 38 pieces of candy, 36 more pieces of candy, and 16 pieces of chocolate. So the total number of pieces of candy is 74, and the total number of pieces of chocolate is 16. The difference between 74 and 16 is 58, so the possible answer is 58.\n\nReasoning: If Bobby ate 38 pieces of candy. Then he ate 36 more. If Bobby ate 74 pieces of candy. And also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. 74 pieces of candy - 16 pieces of chocolate = 58 pieces of candy - chocolate. So he ate"}

The relationship between the two quantities can be represented by the following equation: \n`total books + total pens = 95 + 153 = 248` \nAfter selling some books and pens in the garage sale, Paul is left with 13 books and 23 pens, so the number of books and pens sold can be determined using the equation above. However, this equation does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of books sold, because there are many possible combinations of books and pens that could result in a total of 13 books and 23 pens. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to make a few assumptions about the distribution of books and pens in Paul's original inventory. One common assumption is that the ratio of books to pens remains constant before and after the sale, so we can assume that Paul originally had a 4:6 ratio of books to pens. This means that Paul had 4x books and 6"}

We can make two equations, one for John's cards and one for Jeff's cards. We know that John had 195 cards, and that Nell gave some more cards to Jeff, leaving Nell with 210 cards.\nWe can say 195 cards + (some more) = 210 cards. By removing the extra parentheses, we have 195 cards + some more cards = 210 cards. We know that Nell had 573 cards. So 573 cards - 195 cards - some more cards = 210 cards, and 573 - 195 - some more cards = 210. 573 - 195 = 378, and 378 - 210 = 168. Thus, Nell gave 168 cards to Jeff.\n```Confidence: 75%```"}

Since each classroom has more than one students, the total number of students in 84 classrooms has to be greater than 84. Since there are 118 seats in each bus, the total number of students in 95 buses cannot be more than 95×118, which is around 11200. So the total number of students is at least 84 and at most 11200. The second line tells us that the total number of students is 132.9 times the number of students in a classroom. Let x be the number of students in a classroom. We know x is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Then 132.9x is an integer greater than or equal to 132.9. So x must be between 1 and 132.9, inclusive. This is a small interval compared with the range from 84 to 11200.

What is the cost of each t-shirt?", "correct answer": 43.0, "llm answer": "$ 43", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n```Reasoning: \nIn this question, we're asked to find the cost of each t-shirt sold at the Razorback t-shirt shop. To solve this problem, we need to use the provided information and the relationship between the variables given in the question.\n\nThe first thing we need to do is identify the variables in the problem. In this case, we have two variables: the number of t-shirts sold (x) and the total revenue (y). We're also given the fact that the total revenue is $215.\n\nNext, we need to identify the relationship between these variables. In this case, the relationship is linear, meaning that there is a constant rate at which revenue increases as the number of t-shirts sold increases. We can represent this relationship using the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of m. To do this, we need to use the information given in the question. We're told that when 5 t-shirts are sold, the total revenue is $215. This means that we can substitute 5 for x and 215 for y in the equation y = mx + b and solve for m.\n\nSo, we"}

There is no mention of other friends or extra invitations. I could be mistaken and Carol did not buy the invitations in packs, but she did not give any hints about how she got the invitations. So, I feel like 50% of the time it is possible to send each of her friends 3 invitations in a pack because if they were sent out individually then it is impossible to send them in a pack.

It also tells that she purchased 4 packs of cookie, 22 packs of cake and 16 packs of chocolate. So we are considering three groups of numbers - 4, 22 and 16. Now from the keywords, there are two numbers that are 4 and 22, and the last number is 16. Now the next question is how many items she bought in total. The answer is 4+22+16=42.\nNow when we do this we need to consider 2 things - (a) The context of the problem and (b) The keywords provided by the system. First, the problem asks for the total number of packs. So we know that we need to consider all the numbers in the group. Second, the keywords provide us the information that there are 4 packs of cookie, 22 packs of cake and 16 packs of chocolate. So we can assume that these numbers are the ones we need to consider.\nSo in the context of the problem, we need to consider all the numbers in the group.

How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?", "correct answer": 32.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nReasoning: There are 40 cakes initially, so 8 cakes have been sold, and 32 cakes have been made. The answer must be greater than 8. The answer must also be even, as it must be the difference of two even numbers. There is only one possible answer that fits these criteria.\n\nThis reasoning could be more generalised to be that if you can identify the number of cakes made and the number of cakes sold, you will know how many cakes were not sold. The only numbers between those two numbers that are even and greater than the number of cakes sold are the numbers 12, 16, 20, and 24. If there were 12 cakes not sold, that would mean there were 32 cakes made, and 8 cakes sold. But we know this isn't the case because that would mean that there were 40 cakes to start with, which isn't true. If there were 16 cakes not sold, that would mean there were 56 cakes made, and 40 cakes sold, but we know there were only 40 cakes to start with. If there were 20 cakes not sold, that would mean there were 60 cakes made, and 40 cakes sold, which again doesn't"}

There are 66 students in each classroom in the school. There are 6 seats on each school bus. The first thing that we can notice is that if each of the students in the school go on a bus, it is not possible to have 66 students in each classroom because 66 * 6 = 396, which is greater than 67. It makes sense that we should not be able to put 66 students in each classroom on each bus because each of them have seats for 6 students only. Therefore, we need to find a way to make sure that the number of students in the school is a multiple of 6, so that we can put 6 students on each bus. In this question, the number of students in each classroom is given as 66. Because there are 67 classrooms in the school, we can find the total number of students in the school by multiplying 66 with 67.

By summing these up we can get the number of apples He has as we know how many apples He has more than Adam and Jackie together have. We can then add the two numbers and know that He has that many apples.\n\nFrom the keywords we know Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them. That means the sum of their apples must be 7.\n\nGiven that the only other keywords are 'He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do' and 'Adam and Jackie have 7 apples between them', and the two numbers have to be integers, the only possible combination is: 9 and -2, which gives us 7, as the sum.\n\nIt seems very unlikely that He would have -2 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.\n\nTherefore, He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.\n```"}

He deleted 5 apps.\nWe are asked to determine the number of apps left in his phone. To answer this, we need to understand that the phrase 'left' implies a direction of movement or progress. Therefore, we can infer that the apps are moving in a particular direction. If they were moving in a clockwise direction, the number of apps left would be 19 - 5 = 14. However, since the direction of movement is not specified, we cannot assume it is clockwise or counterclockwise. Therefore, the correct answer is either 14 or 5. The given information is sufficient to determine that the number of apps left in his phone is either 14 or 5, but it is not sufficient to determine which one is correct. To determine which one is correct, we need additional information, such as the direction of movement of the apps.

As soon as you see this keyword, you should know that the answer is 3.\n- `14 cookies`: we can see from this keyword that there are 14 cookies total.\n- `7 bags`: there are 7 bags. You can also see from the keyword that all bags have the same number of cookies because we have the keywords `equal` and `have`.\n\nOnce we have these keywords, we can work out the answer. We know that there are 14 cookies and 7 bags, so we divide 14 by 7. This gives us 2, but that is not the answer.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 25.0, "llm answer": "48", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation:\n```In reasoning, I noticed that there is an unknown number of bird families in Africa and Asia. If we can find the number of birds in Africa and Asia, we can then deduct the remaining birds in mountain area. Also, since the number of bird families flying to Africa and Asia are already known, we only need to calculate the number of birds that flying to Africa and the number of birds that flying to Asia. From the first sentence, we can deduct that 23 bird families flew to Africa, which means 23 * (1 unknown number) = x, which means x = 23 * (1 unknown number) (for the same reason, y = 37 * (1 unknown number). We can also deduct that x + y + 85 = 85 bird families living near the mountain, which means 85 = x + y + 85, which means x + y = 0. So x = -y. Now we have x = 23 * (1 unknown number), which means (1 unknown number) = x / 23. Since y = x, we have y = 37 * x / 23, which means (1 unknown number) = y / 37. So (1 unknown number"}

Then we got:\n```\nMarco's strawberries: 30 pounds\nHis dad's strawberries: x pounds\nTheir combined strawberries: 47 pounds\n```\nFrom the problem, we know that the total amount of Marco and his dad's strawberries is 47 pounds, which means\n```\n30 pounds + x pounds = 47 pounds\n```\nSince we know that Marco's strawberries is 30 pounds, then we can just subtract 30 pounds from both sides of the equation to get\n```\n30 pounds + x pounds - 30 pounds = 47 pounds - 30 pounds\nx pounds = 17 pounds\n```\nFrom the equation above, we know that his dad's strawberries is 17 pounds.\nAnd the question asks about how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's, which means we are looking for the difference between Marco's strawberries and his dad's strawberries.

{"question": "The bananas in Philip's collection are organized into 196 groups. If there are a total of 392 bananas in Philip's banana collection. How big is each group?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning: Philip has 392 bananas and has 196 groups. There are two ways to calculate the size of each group. We can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups (392/196) or we can multiply the number of groups by the average number of bananas in each group (196 × 2). The first approach yields 2 bananas in each group and the second approach yields 392 bananas in each group. The first approach seems more plausible because Philip has stated that he has 196 groups and 392 bananas total, and it is unlikely that each group has 196 bananas. Thus, the answer 2 is the most likely correct one.\n\nQ: Which keywords (if any) you think is not useful for you to reason the above problem?\nKeywords not useful for reasoning: []\nReasoning: The keywords '196 groups' and '392 bananas total' are very useful for reasoning the above problem because they directly indicate the size of each group.

This means that all boys were given a total of 90 marbles. Since 9 boys have been given 90 marbles, then 90/9=10 marbles should have been given to each of the 9 boys. However, 9 marbles are given to each of the 9 boys. Therefore, 99 is not the correct answer."}

So Ron's height is x. Water's depth is 16x.\nDean is 9 feet taller than Ron, so Ron's height is 9 feet less than Dean's. Let's assume Dean's height is x + 9.\nWe can deduce that water's depth is 13 + 16(x-9).\nIt's also given that water's depth is 16 times Ron's height, so water's depth is 16x, which is the same as 13 + 16(x-9) = 16x.\nx = 13 + 16(x-9) / 16\nx = 230 / 16 = 14.375 feet\n13 + 16(x-9) = 13 + 16(14.375 - 9) = 230 feet\nSo the answer is 230 feet.\n\nQ: I am not an expert of the field.

How far did the frog jump?", "correct answer": 58.0, "llm answer": "41", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n```Reasoning:\nWe have a frog that jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper (19 inches). That's 58 inches. The mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog (58 - 94 = -36 inches). That means the mouse jumped 36 inches. 58 + 36 = 94. We have a frog that jumped 58 inches, and a mouse that jumped 36 inches. Therefore, the total distance the frog and mouse jumped (i.e. the frog jumped 58 inches and the mouse jumped 36 inches farther than the grasshopper, i.e. 58+36 = 94 inches) is the same as the total distance the mouse and grasshopper jumped (i.e. 94 inches).\n```If the frog jumped 41 inches, and we use the same logic as above, the mouse jumps 43 inches, and the total distance the mouse and grasshopper jumped is 63 inches. Thus, the frog jumped 31 inches, which is not what we want.\nTherefore, I think that answer 41 is not correct. It should be closer to 58 inches (the frog jumped 58 inches farther than the grasshopper) instead.```"}

She doesn't have 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 apples. So she has either 9 or 11 apples, and if Jackie has 9 apples, then Adam has to have 14 apples.

How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?", "correct answer": 274.0, "llm answer": "274", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation: Considering the keywords as additional information, it's easy to find out that Rachel went to see the Buckingham palace after eating a hearty meal, and therefore, they ate at night. The number 132 refers to the number of visitors to the Buckingham palace that day, and the number 406 refers to the number of visitors to the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days. We are asked to calculate how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If n is the number of visitors on the previous day, then the number of visitors that day is n + 132. So the total number of visitors within the past 327 days is (n + 132) × 327. Since the total number of visitors within the past 327 days is 406, we can obtain n as follows: n = 406 – 132 × 327 = 274 Therefore, the number of visitors on the previous day is 274.\n\nConfidence: 88%\nExplanation: Based on the given keywords, we can infer that the day Rachel ate a hearty meal was at night.
