Response: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber needed. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.  
Step 2: Determine the amount of white fiber needed. It is half the amount of blue fiber, which is 2 รท 2 = 1 bolt.  
Step 3: Compute the total number of bolts. Add the bolts of blue fiber (2) and white fiber (1) to get 3 bolts.
Final Answer: 3
