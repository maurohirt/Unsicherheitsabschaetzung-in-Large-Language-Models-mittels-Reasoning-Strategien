And then since 14 books is not in the choices, we are left with the answer 60.\"\n- Justification: There is a lot of information presented in the prompt that seems irrelevant, so we should probably use only the numbers that are directly connected to the question (e.g., 2, 7, and 30). However, it seems like these numbers were not picked randomly. They may be connected to something. The only plausible connection is the idea that Mrs. Hilt read 2 books per day, and she read books for a week. This indicates that there are 7 days in a week, so 2 * 7 = 14 books per week. Since 14 books is not in the choices, we can move on to the next number, 30. This number is not directly related to anything we have so far, so we need to look at the prompt again. 30 is not an exact multiple of 7, which suggests that it is likely the number of days per month.

And the sum of 34 and 28 is 62.\n\nQ: So you think the possible answer must be 62 because of these keywords? Could you be wrong about your thinking?\nReasoning: My reasoning can be wrong because it's an incomplete reasoning. The reason it's incomplete is that it only uses the keywords to help answer this question. However, when using the keywords to answer a question, the keywords alone are not sufficient to guarantee the answer. For example, there are other possible answers for the same keywords: ['34 - 28', '62']\n\nQ: Is your reasoning good enough or can you come up with a better reasoning to prove that your answer is correct?\nReasoning: Yes, my reasoning is good enough because when the keywords are '34 - 28', '62', the answer must be the sum of two numbers, one is 34, the other one is 28. But as I said, the sum of 34 and 28 is 62. Therefore, the answer must be 62.\n\n"}

However, a common problem when starting out with Bayesian statistics is that they can be difficult to grasp intuitively. In fact, it is often claimed that Bayesian statistics are not easily understood at a more intuitive level, and that only a solid mathematical background is sufficient for a true understanding. However, in a psychological context, Bayesian inference is more like the logic that we use in everyday life (even though we may not be aware of that). It simply is an application of the logic behind the famous expression “it is 2 out of 3 times likely that there is a cat in the bag, if we have seen the cat twice and not seen a dog once”. As shown below, this is also the essence of Bayesian inference. The following two paragraphs explain this on an intuitive level. For a more detailed introduction to Bayesian inference in general, see Kruschke (2015).\n\nWhen making a decision on the basis of data, or making an inference on the basis of prior knowledge and data, there are two kinds of errors that we want to avoid: 1) We want to avoid making an"}

This implies that the 25 cents from quarters must be more than just 3 cents. Since Rob has 12 pennies, that means that Rob has $1.20 in pennies. So the total must be at least $1.20 + $2.05 = $3.25.

Can you please elaborate on the difference between \"short-run\" and \"long-run\" in economics? I'm really struggling to understand it.\nAnswer:\nHi there! In economics, we often talk about short-run and long-run effects or implications of certain policies or events. The short-run is typically considered a relatively shorter time frame, such as a few months or a year, while the long-run is often thought of as a much longer time frame, such as several years or decades. It's important to note that the distinction between the short-run and long-run is not always clear-cut, and the time frame considered as \"short-run\" or \"long-run\" may vary depending on the specific context. For example, in macroeconomic models, the short-run might refer to the time it takes for markets to adjust to changes in prices or supply and demand, which could be a few days or weeks. Meanwhile, the long-run might refer to the time it takes for factors such as capital accumulation, technological advancements, or demographic shifts to fully take effect, which could take years or even decades. One important way that the"}

The keyword ‘650’ is the total amount that the girl donated. The keyword ‘175’ is the amount she donated to the first orphanage, and ‘250’ is the amount she donated to the third orphanage. To solve the problem, we first divide 650 by 175 to obtain 3.714. Since 650 is divided by 175, we multiply the quotient (3.714) by 250. This gives us 925. Hence, we subtract 925 from 650, obtaining 25. We can check our result. The keyword ‘225’ represents the amount she donated to the second orphanage, and since she donated a total of $650, we can subtract 225 from 650 to obtain 425. Since 425 is the amount she donated to the second orphanage plus the amount she donated to the third orphanage, we subtract 250 from 425, obtaining 175. This confirms that she donated $175 to the first orphanage. Hence"}

Since there are 3 questions, and the correct answer must be the one that best fits the given scenario, then there must be more constraints than just 984 people. So I assume 246 is not the total number of people that each section can accommodate, but rather, the total number of people each section can accommodate after certain seats are already occupied. Therefore, each section can actually accommodate more than 246 people.\nConsidering each section, 246 is the maximum number of seats that the section can accommodate after some seats are already occupied. This means 246 must be the maximum number of remaining seats, so the number of seats that is already occupied must be smaller than 246. The difference must be less than 246, and it must be an integer. The difference that fits this criteria is 2.

In the keywords list, we see a keyword `478 pages per book`. It is not immediately obvious how many pages each book has, so we try to reason about it. The question asks us to find out the total number of pages of the `8 books`, so we are looking for the total pages. Therefore, the number of pages per book will not affect the answer, so we can use the keyword `8 books` to find out the total pages. Since there are 8 books, we just multiply 8 with 478 pages per book to find out the total number of pages"}

If every box can contain 100 sheets,. how many boxes does she need?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation:\nThe first thing you should notice is that the question contains a clear unit: sheets. If you ignore the unit of measurement and just say '700', '100', '7', you might think that 700 sheets should go into 7 boxes. But wait! 700 sheets does not equal 700 units of measurement: 700 sheets is 700 sheets, NOT 700 sheets, and each box can only contain 100 sheets. Therefore 7 boxes can only hold 700 sheets, so you can not place all the 700 sheets into 7 boxes.\nIn a sense, 'unit' is a type of 'keyword', which you should keep in mind.

How many feet are there on the branches?", "correct answer": 92.0, "llm answer": "92", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n```Reasoning: If each bird stands on one foot, then the number of feet is the same as the number of birds, namely 46. But the question says that there are 46 birds perched on the branches. So there are many birds perched on one branch. Each branch has many birds, and the total number of feet is still 46. But each bird needs one foot to stand on. Therefore, each bird needs two feet to stand. So there are 92 feet, and the answer is 92.```\n"}

You are given two possible answers, and you must determine the likelihood of each. You must then select the most likely answer.\n\nThe question is asking you to consider how many legs there are in a group of 115 cows grazing in a pasture. You must first consider the fact that each cow has four legs, and then use that knowledge to determine the likelihood of each answer.\n\nThe correct answer is that there are 116 legs in the group of 115 cows grazing in the pasture. This is because each cow has four legs, and there are 115 cows. Therefore, the total number of legs is 116.\n\nThe reasoning behind the possible answer is that there are 29 cows, and each cow has four legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is 116.\n\nConsidering the keywords, the answer is still 116 legs. The keywords do not change the fact that each cow has four legs, and there are 115 cows.

Please write a short justification. \nThe answer is unreasonable because the number of pieces and the cost of each piece are given in a single sentence. The reason why people write a number followed by a measurement unit is that they would like people to think of the number in relation to the measurement unit, in this case dollars. However, when the cost of each piece is given in cents, people should focus on the number 18 without thinking of the measurement unit cent. The reason why the answer is unreasonable is because it tries to focus on the relationship between two measurement units, cent and dollars, which is not the main idea in the text.\n"}

I chose a random square within the sandbox to find the area, which is 4 x 4 = 16, and then used the number of squares to determine the length of the sandbox, which is 312/16 = 20. The width of the sandbox is 146/16 = 9, and so the answer is 20 x 9 = 180, and then multiplied by 16 to get 2880. The final answer of 45528 is obtained by adding 2880 to the original area of 1 square to get 2881, and then multiplying by 16 to get 45856, and then adding 2880 to get 45528.

I should probably also have been more clear about how I got my answer, but since I didn't I guess I'm not surprised that I got it wrong, and I don't expect people to be able to read my mind on how I arrived at it. I'm really interested in learning how to reason about these questions, and my confidence that the answer is correct was based more on my confidence in my reasoning than it was my ability to communicate it effectively.\n\nI was wrong because I assumed the colors of the candies were distributed equally. I didn't know whether or not there were actually only two colors of candies, but I thought it made more sense than there being three colors. If there were three colors, then I would expect that they might be 145 red, 3,264 blue, and then 0 green (or some other color), but that would be strange because it implies that every candy was red or blue. I thought it was more likely that the number of green pieces would be much lower than 145, and I had to do more work to figure out what those numbers"}

How many more bags of dog food are there than cat food?", "correct answer": 273.0, "llm answer": "273", "confidence": 0.968, "probing response": "96.8%\n\nReasoning: The question is asking for the difference between two numbers. It mentions there are 600 bags of dog food, 327 bags of cat food and then asks how many more bags of dog food are there than cat food. We could use a number line and think about each of the numbers in the context of the question. With 600 being a multiple of 100, we can say that it is close to the 600 on the number line. Similarly, we can say that 327 is close to the 300 on the number line. Since there are more bags of dog food than cat food, the dog food number is farther from 0 on the number line than the cat food number. Therefore, it makes sense that the difference between the two numbers is positive. This means that the correct answer is a number greater than 0. There are 273 more bags of dog food than cat food.\n```273 - 327 = -54```\nTherefore, the correct answer is 273.\n"}

The answer '3' is incorrect because it does not take into account the given information. The keywords '3', '5' imply that 3 brown candy boxes are remaining after 5 boxes are bought.\n\n# The answer '3' is incorrect because the reasoning is flawed.

We can use the given information to calculate the number of days needed. \nFirst, we need to find out how many vases Jane can arrange in one day. We are given that she can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. \nNext, we need to find out how many days it will take her to arrange 248 vases of flowers. We can use the formula Days = Vases/Per Day where Vases is the number of vases Jane needs to arrange and Per Day is the number of vases she can arrange in one day. So, Days = 248 / 16 = 15.5 days. So, it will take 15.5 days for Jane to arrange all 248 vases of flowers.```"}
{"question": "Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. If there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged,. how many vases of flowers will she arrange on the last day?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8 vases", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe number 248, with the unit vases, is not divisible by the number 16, thus 248/16 should not be an integer. So Jane can only arrange vases on the last day if the number of vases arranged in a day is less than 16. 14 vases are arranged in one day, thus 14 is the lowest possible number Jane could arrange on the last day, and it should be a multiple of 16 as well. 8 vases is the closest integer to 248/16, and it is the largest number that is less than 14. Thus I choose the answer as 8. This is only an approximate calculation and Jane can arrange more than 8 vases if she works extra hours or she can only arrange 8 vases if her task is more difficult than the description of the question suggests. For the last point, Jane's task could be arranging vases in an exhibition where they have to be arranged in a specific way, for example, a certain vase can only be placed on a certain stand. So Jane has to find a way to place all the vases on the stand and also consider the restriction of the vase arrangement."}

How many balloons are left?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "35", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nAnswer: 35\n\nExplanation:\nFrom the information, the balloons should be divided into 7 groups, and all groups should have the same amount of balloons, so X should be the amount of balloons in each group. This means that there are 7 X balloons in total.\nIt is given that 39 balloons should be divided, so 7 X should be 39. This means that 7 X = 39.\nIn order to solve this equation, we need to divide both sides by 7.\nDividing both sides by 7 gives us that X = 5.5.\nSince we want to divide the balloons into groups of 7, this means that the amount of balloons left is 7 X – 39. Substituting X = 5.5 gives us that the amount of balloons left is 7 x 5.5 – 39, which is 35."}

In other words we want to maximize Y.\n\nX is expressed as a function of Y. If we make Y larger, that will make X smaller. So, we will want to make Y as large as possible. Y must be a non-negative integer so the largest Y that can be made is 12.\n\nWith 12 large groups of size 7 there are 84 people.

The number of possible combinations can be calculated using the formula: nCr = n! / r! (n - r)!, where n is the total number of players and r is the number of games played with each other. In this case, n = 4 and r = 2, so the number of possible combinations is 4C2 = 4! / 2! (4 - 2)! = 6.\n2. From this number of possible combinations, we can calculate the probability of any given combination being chosen by dividing the number of combinations by the total number of possible combinations. In this case, the probability of the combination being chosen is 1/6.\n3. Based on the given information and the reasoning above, we can conclude"}

How did you arrive at this answer?\n\nAnswer: Since there are 4 * 6 = 24 hours in a day and the question tells us that Martin works 24 hours, that means that there are 24/24 = 1 day in a week. This means that Martin works 1 day in a week. Since Martin sells 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock, that means that he sells 48 * 1 = 48 hamburgers in a day. Since he sells 28 hamburgers more than that after 6 o'clock, that means that he sells 48 + 28 = 76 hamburgers after 6 o'clock. This means that he sells 48 + 76 = 124 hamburgers in total, which means that he sells 124 * 1 = 124 hamburgers in a week. Since there are 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock, that means that there are 124 - 48 = 76 hamburgers after 6 o'clock.\n\nNote: If you answered this question before reading the reasoning, I suggest you answer it again after reading the reasoning.\n\nQ: What do you think about the answers from"}

So, if she brought 16 to school, she must've left 16 at home too (for every thing brought to school, there's the same amount of thing left at home).

To do that, we need to figure out how much each coin adds up to 77.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n```29 + dimes + nickles + pennies = 77```\n\nWe know that 29 quarters make up 29 dollars.\n\nTo find out how many dimes it takes to make 48 dollars, we need to know how much each dime is worth.

Here, we find that Kevin collected 14 toys. Then, Kevin collected 18 frisbees and several yo-yos. To have 50 prizes in all, the remaining toys have to be 18. Therefore, the answer is correct. For the second part, we know that Kevin has 50 prizes in all. The answer is the one with 18 as the number of yo-yos. As 50 is a number of toys with 18 frisbees and several yo-yos, we can be 100% confident that the answer is correct."}

The basic idea is to systematically consider every possible answer choice and try to rule out choices that do not satisfy all the constraints. For the above problem, we can first consider the answer choices that are larger than the constraint value (i.e. 48). That is, we can rule out all the choices that are smaller than or equal to the constraint value. So, we can first remove the choices of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Then, we can consider the choices that are smaller than the constraint value. That is, we can rule out all the choices that are larger than or equal to the constraint value. So, we can first remove the choices of 9, 10, 11, and 12. Then, we can consider the remaining choices, which are 7, 8,"}

For example, the baker puts 3 cupcakes on the first tray, and 6 cupcakes on the second tray, which is twice the number of cupcakes on the first tray.\n\nTo determine how many cupcakes the baker will put on the fifth tray, we need to continue this pattern.

To have more information to work with we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30 and get:\n30*6 apartments / 2.5 hours = 30 apartments / x hours\n180 apartments / 2.5 hours = 30 apartments / x hours\nx = 2.5 hours * 30 apartments / 180 apartments\nx = 2.5 hours * 30 / 180\nx = 2.5 hours * 1/6\nx = 2.5/6 hours\nx = 0.41667 hours\nWhich is the inverse of the time it takes to clean 6 apartments (1/6) times 2.5 hours.\nSo in 12.5 hours Aarav cleans 30 apartments\n\nThis solution is not correct.

I think the keyword \"17 students\" is important though and gives me a chance to narrow down my reasoning to a specific group of answer choices. I think the keyword \"11/17\" is important because it suggests the answer choice that divides the two numbers. I also think \"17/11\" and \"11/17\" can be excluded because it is unlikely for two answers to have the same value, so the next step is to figure out whether 11/17 is the correct answer.\n\nMy reasoning:\n- I am a student who wants lemonade, so I will assume that the 17 students who want lemonade have a larger group than the 11 students who want iced tea. This means that the ratio of the number of students who want iced tea to the number of students who want lemonade should be smaller than 1/17 (because 17/11 > 1).\n- If we assume that there are fewer students who want lemonade, we will get a ratio greater than 1/17.

When you consider the keywords, it is helpful to first ask yourself what the keywords can be used for. Since the keywords are the number of sundaes with nuts and the number of sundaes without nuts, you can use these information to calculate the number of total sundaes. Then, you can use the calculated total sundaes and the original ratio of the number of sundaes with nuts to the number of sundaes without nuts to infer what the ratio should be. \n\n2. To calculate the total number of sundaes, the key part is to calculate the number of sundaes with nuts, which is 27. Then, since there are 27 sundaes with nuts, there are $27+2=29$ sundaes in total. \n\n3. Once you know the number of sundaes in total, the new ratio of the number of sundaes with nuts to the number of sundaes without nuts is $\\frac{27}{2}=\\frac{27}{2}$, which is the answer. \n\n"}

We want to compare the number of pizzas without pepperoni to the number of pizzas with pepperoni. There are 2 ways of doing so, as follows.\nFirst way: If we put pizzas without pepperoni at the numerator, then we need to put pizzas with pepperoni at the denominator, giving us `frac{2}{13}`. This fraction is equal to 0.15.\nSecond way: If we put pizzas with pepperoni at the numerator, then we need to put pizzas without pepperoni at the denominator, giving us `frac{13}{2}`. This fraction is equal to 6.5.\nThe correct answer should be the first way because the context does not say anything about comparing pizzas without pepperoni to the pizzas in general. That is, we are not comparing 2 to 15, but comparing 2 to 13. So the correct answer is the fraction `frac{2}{13}`.\nSince there are 13 pizzas with pepperoni and 2 pizzas without pepperoni, the ratio is 2 to 13.

There are two methods that we can use: linear function or exponential function. To figure out the function type, we need to observe the pattern of the data. The number of carrot cakes increases 2 each month (November has 1 more than October, December has 1 more than November, and so on). This means the increase is linear, therefore the function type is linear. With this, we can use the linear function y=mx+b to solve this question.\n\nm=change of the number of carrot cakes from the previous month/month (change over time)\n\nb=initial value of the number of carrot cakes when t=0\n\nSince the linear function passes through the origin (0,0), we can deduce that the initial value of the number of carrot cakes when t=0 is 0, therefore b=0.\n\nNow, to find the value of m, we can create a table:\n\nWe see that the increase is 2 each month, therefore the change of the number of carrot cakes from the previous month/month (change over time) is 2. Therefore m=2.\n\nSo, with all these information, the function is y"}

Therefore, he will have to find the LCM of 90 and 72. Then, dividing the LCM by n gives the required length of each piece. Jeremy wants to cut 4 pieces, hence LCM/4 gives the length of each piece of wood after cutting.```\n```Answer: LCM of 90 and 72 is 360. Hence the length of each piece is 360/4 = 90.```\n\nIn this reasoning, which of the following reasoning steps are incorrect?\n1. Jeremy wants to cut the both pieces of wood into 'n' pieces so that all these pieces are the same length.

{"question": "Amy had some candy. She gave her friend six pieces and had five left. What's the difference between of the pieces of candy Amy gave away and the left?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1 piece", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nSolution: I think the answer is correct. The first sentence states \"Amy had some candy.\"  In this context, \"had\" means Amy owned some candy. The second sentence says \"She gave her friend six pieces and had five left.\"  This implies that Amy's friend received six pieces of candy from Amy and Amy was left with five pieces.  To get to this point, she must have given six pieces to her friend, so she was originally left with 5 + 6 = 11 pieces.  After that, she gave 6 pieces to her friend, so she was left with 11 - 6 = 5 pieces.  Since the question asks about the difference between the number of pieces she gave to her friend and the number of pieces she had left, the difference is 6 - 5 = 1.  This means that the answer is correct."}

Then $x$ can be anything from $0$ to $91$.  The answer choices are all less than or equal to $71$, so at least some of them are right.  Let $a$ denote the number of hot dogs they had left.  Then $a$ can be anything from $0$ to $91$.  Since $a \\lt 91$, and $a$ is nonnegative, $a \\in \\{ 0,1,2,3, \\ldots,90 \\}$.  Hence the answer can be anything from $1$ to $71$.  Since $1$ is not an answer choice, the correct answer must be one of $2,3,4,5,\\ldots,71$.\n\nSo which of these is the most likely?  That would be the one which is closest to the average, which is $$\\frac{2+3+4+\\ldots+71}{71}=\\frac{71 \\cdot 72}{2}$$\nwhich is about $2551$, so the answer is $2560$.\n\nThis is not one of the answer choices,"}

The endpoints are called primary solutions. \n```[-53.13, 180 - 53.13 = 126.87]```\n\nTo get the correct answer, we need to convert the angles to the first quadrant (0 < x < 90) and choose the correct answer. \nIn the first quadrant, the primary solution is 53.13. \nHence, the correct answer is 53.13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36 degrees."}

I guess that 1) Drew has been paid for cutting the grass and 2) he received some money for cutting the grass. I am not sure how the author described it. He/she may use the past continuous or simple past or the present perfect to describe the event. If the present perfect is used, Drew has been paid for cutting the grass, and this implies that he has been paid for the event of cutting the grass. So the author describes the event in a passive way. This is likely to happen because we are likely to talk about something passive when talking about an amount of money received. In other words, we do not usually talk about something active and passive when we are talking about money.\nTherefore, I have two possibilities. The first one is that Drew has been paid for cutting the grass. This would mean that the answer is 31. The other possibility is that Drew has been paid for cutting the grass and he received some money for cutting the grass. This would mean that the answer is 51. Based on my reasoning, I am 95% confident that the answer is 31."}

Therefore the new number minus the original number must be the number he stacked.\n```A bale is a large rectangle with width w = 1 foot, height h = 4 feet and length l = 4 feet.

I first eliminated the answer of 16 because dogs are always plural in this question. Then I think about why we plant 18 new trees today, it is because the park workers do not want the existing dog trees to be destroyed. So, the number of new dog trees is equal to the number of trees that have already been there, so the answer is 18.\n```Confidence: 80%```\n```Reasoning: The reasoning is that I am pretty confident to eliminate the answer 16 and I guess it's probably 18. However, I am not 100% sure it is 18 since the information from the question is pretty limited. And if we can prove it is 18 then we should also be able to prove that the answer is not 56 or 54.

By subtracting the second equation from the first one, you get 2x+x = 35-13 = 22 or 3x = 22, thus x = 22/3 = 7.33. You can now substitute this into either equation to get y = 35-2x = 35-14.66 = 20.34. Therefore the two numbers are approximately 7.33 and 20.34."}

We know that the sum of the two pieces is equal to 8 feet, which means $x + (x + 2) = 8$.

What will the new area be?", "correct answer": 100.0, "llm answer": "100", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Confidence: 80%```\n\nThis problem is an instance of a \"Double-Sided Growth Problem\". A double-sided growth problem is a problem that involves growing one or more of the dimensions of a shape (such as enlarging or reducing a side of a rectangle) and computing the new area. In this specific problem, Angie decided to enlarge the photo by doubling the sides.\n\nThe new area of the square photo can be calculated by doubling each side and multiplying it by itself. Since the sides are squared, doubling a side and then squaring it results in a new area that is four times the original area. In other words, the new area is 25 times 4, which is equal to 100 square inches. This means that the area of the square photo is increased by a factor of 4 when the sides are doubled.\n\nSince this problem is a double-sided growth problem, it is important to remember to double both sides and then multiply by itself. This will ensure that the area is correctly computed."}

What is the perimeter of the picture frame?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "30", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nReasoning:\nIn order to solve this, we first need to make sure we understand what \"perimeter\" and \"width\" and \"height\" means. The perimeter of something is the distance around it. To get the perimeter of this frame, we would add up all the distances that make up the frame. For this example, we can ignore the fact that the frame is actually made up of two identical frames, since all the distances around them are the same.\n\nFor the width, we need to find the distance from the left side of the frame to the right side. That distance is 6 inches.\n\nFor the height, we need to find the distance from the bottom of the frame to the top. That distance is 9 inches.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the frame, we would add those two distances together. The perimeter of this frame is 6+9, which is 15 inches. Since we know that the correct answer must be the sum of the two distances, the answer is 30 inches.\n\nIf we think back to the keywords given, we can see that the question asked us to find the perimeter of the frame, so our answer is correct.\n\n```Confidence: 50%```\nThis problem is quite straightforward and could"}

{"question": "A buffet offers ranch or caesar dressing. The ratio of ranch dressing used to caesar dressing used is 7:1. If the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing,. how many cases of caesar do they use?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "32", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nReasoning: The first sentence states the ratio between ranch and caesar, therefore we can see there will be 7 caesar for every 1 ranch. The second sentence tells us the number of ranch dressing is 28, so we can divide 28 by 7 to get the number of caesar dressing, 4. However, the question says that the answer is in terms of \"cases\". We already know that there is 7 times more caesar dressing than ranch dressing, therefore we can multiply 4 by 7 to get the number of cases of caesar dressing used, 28. Since the question asks for cases, we can see that answer 32 is the correct one.\n```\nReasoning: The question is asking for the number of cases of Caesar dressing. We are given that the ratio of ranch dressing to Caesar dressing is 7:1. The question states that the buffet uses 28 cases of ranch dressing, so we can set up a proportion. Since 28 cases of ranch dressing is equal to 4 cases of Caesar dressing, we know that 28 cases of ranch dressing is equal to 7 times 4 cases of Caesar dressing.

Introduction\nIn this assignment, we apply the concepts of machine learning to generate natural language questions.\nWe start by generating keywords by extracting a bag of words (BoW) from given passage and questions. The keyword extractor first splits the passages and questions into sentences and further splits each sentence into tokens (words). It then converts each token into a vector by counting the frequency of occurrence of each token within the given corpus. The BoW for the given corpus is formed by concatenating these vectors. Finally, the BoW is used to generate questions.\n\nThe goal of this assignment is to generate a question from the given passage. The model takes a paragraph, and for each sentence in the paragraph generates one or more questions.\nWe first use the given BoW to extract keywords from the paragraph.

Why did you think the answer was 10 when the keyword was ['7']?\n\nReasoning:\nI decided to use a different strategy than the ones used in the video because it's less likely to get an answer that isn't correct and more likely to get an answer that is correct. I thought about the first keyword and looked for it in the answer, but it wasn't there. Then I saw that the only possible answer with both 3 and 7 was 10, which I thought made sense since I knew that Amy had 3 pencils already and she bought 7 at the store, which would give her 10 pencils altogether. So my confidence was 80% because I was pretty sure it was correct but I didn't want to say 100% just in case.\n\nSo I think you should ask more questions like this to help students understand how reasoning works and what kind of keywords are useful for different strategies when answering questions.

If each shelf in his room can hold 8 figures,. how many shelves does he need?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: The question asks us to find how many shelves he needs. We know the number of action figures and the maximum number of action figures that can be stored on a shelf. The total number of shelves we need is the number of action figures divided by the maximum number of action figures on a shelf. Here 64 is not divisible by 8 so the next bigger number divisible by 8 is 64/0.8 = 80.

Since the amount of money spent on the adults was $5, and the amount of money spent on the children was also $5, the amount spent per person is 5/2 = $2.50. So for Amy's dad and the kids, the amount spent is 2.50 \\* 2 = $5 and for the adults, it's 2.50 \\* 3 = $7.5. This gives us the total of $5 + $7.5 = $12.5.\n\nHowever, the answer given is $10, which is incorrect, as we can see that the total amount of money spent is $12.5, which is greater than the answer provided.

How much money does he have now?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12 dollars", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nPossible Reasoning:\nSince the amount Jerry had was reduced by $6, he now has the remainder of the original amount, $18-6=12$. This is the best reasoning I could give for such a question, because Jerry does not have a specific monetary amount to spend on anything, and this question does not specify any further information.\n\n```Example: In the question\n```\nQ: The sum of two numbers is 30. One of them is 10 more than the other. What are the two numbers?\n```\nAnswer: 20, 10\n```Confidence: 100%```\nExplanation: Because the sum of two numbers is 30 and one of them is 10 more than the other, then the second number is 30 minus 10, or 20. Thus, the two numbers are 20 and 10.\nThe second number, the one 10 more than the other number, is the same as the number 10 added to the first number. So, the second number is 20, and the first number is 20 minus 10, or 10.\nTherefore, the two numbers are 20 and 10.\n\nHowever, for the question above, the reasoning for Jerry's monetary situation"}

The question tells us that Maria had something, and then, it's *she ate sixty-four pieces* which means *she had something and then she ate something*. We can see that the verb *had* is the beginning of a sequence,"}

How many quarters did he have to start with?", "correct answer": 88.0, "llm answer": "88", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nReasoning:\nThe question is about subtraction, i.e., the number of quarters Adam starts with minus the number of quarters he spent at the arcade is 79. To find the answer, we need to find two numbers whose difference is 79.\n\nWe can first write down the two numbers and try to solve it using subtraction:\n\n`[x, y] -> x - y = 79` \n\nAfter many trials, we might notice that the answer could be `88` and `9`. However, since this is a multiple-choice test and we have 4 options in total, we are not sure if it is correct.\n\nTherefore, we need to check if `88 - 9 = 79` and if it is correct. By checking the keywords, we can see `9 quarters` and `79 quarters`, and both numbers are used in the subtraction. Therefore, the `88 quarters` is the most likely answer. We also know that the number we are subtracting from is larger than the number we are subtracting. In other words, the number we are subtracting is less than the number we are subtracting from, and `9 quarters` is smaller than `88 quarters`.\n\nThe conclusion is, `88 quarters` is the most"}

And Frank read 2 pages at school, 3 on the bus and 3 at home. This means that these locations are the order of his reading. Therefore, the possible answer must be the order of 2, 3, 3, which is 8.\n```\n- In this example, we only need to count the number of pages. We know the locations, but we don't know the details. For example, Frank could read 2 pages in school on different days or even at different times. \n- It is unlikely that Frank read 5 pages in school and 2 at home, because it doesn't fit the context of reading for 3 pages in the bus. Frank could not have read 5 pages in the bus. Thus, the location is very important. The information that Frank read 3 pages in the bus is not only the number of pages but also the order. Therefore, we can't count this as two different pieces of information. In this example, this is the only information about Frank's reading.

This reasoning is not strong enough, however, so I am not confident that it's the correct answer. \nThe answer I think most likely is 5 cars sold each day, which would give a mean of 5.5. However, the keywords give some hints that there might be a slight increase from Monday to Wednesday, so 4.5 is a possibility. The most unlikely answer would be 4 cars sold everyday, because the keywords imply that there is a slight increase after Monday. This reasoning is not strong enough, however, so I am not confident that it's the correct answer. \nTherefore, the confidence"}

We should notice that both of the things Mrs. Evans needs to give to her students are finite (she will not give all her crayons to her students if there are a lot of students in her class). Now the second information from the question is `each student gets equal number of crayons and equal number of paper`. Then, if the class has 30 students, the teacher has to give 4 crayons and 1 paper for each of them. Hence, if she has 30 students, she will still have 120-4×30=60 crayons, which is 2×30.

In each of those 5 rows, there are 4 boys. In each of those 4 rows, there are 5 girls. So 4 * 5 + 5 * 4 = 36 + 20 = 56. This means the number of boys in the rows with all girls is 36 - 4 = 32. But there are only 72 boys total. So we would not be able to fill out all the rows with all boys or all girls and have equal rows. We can use 5 rows of 8 girls and 4 rows of 8 boys and still have 5 rows of 8 boys and 4 rows of 8 girls.

This means that the number of nuts and bolts must be the same. Since the store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8, the smallest number of nuts that Ezra can buy is the lowest common multiple of 13 and 8.\nTo find the lowest common multiple, we can start with the smaller number, which is 8. We know that 8 is a factor of 8, so we can multiply 8 by 13 to get 104, which is the smallest multiple of 13 that is also a multiple of 8. However, since Ezra wants to buy the same number of nuts and bolts, we need to divide 104 by 13 to get the actual number of nuts that Ezra can buy.\nTo divide 104 by 13, we can use long division. We start by writing 104 as a decimal, and then write 13 above it. We then divide the first digit of 104 by 13 to get 7, and write it below the 104. We then multiply 7 by 13 to get 91, and write it below the 104. We then subtract "}

{"question": "P and Q start at the same time in the same direction to run around a stadium. P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. After what time will they meet again at the starting point?", "correct answer": 2772.0, "llm answer": "126 seconds", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nPossible Answer: 252 seconds\nExplanation: \n```First, the question states that P and Q start at the same time. Second, it says that P completes a round in 252 seconds and Q in 198 seconds, both starting at the same point. If we take one round of the stadium as a clock, 252 seconds is 252/360 degrees. This means P completes a round by traveling at a rate of 252/360 degrees per second. Q completes a round in 198 seconds, so it travels at a rate of 198/360 degrees per second. P and Q will meet again at the starting point when P and Q have traveled the same distance in the same time. This is a relative question, so it is important to identify the keywords relative distance and relative time. This means that, when P and Q meet again, they will have traveled the same relative distance (i.e., both will have traveled one full round). Therefore, when P and Q meet again, both will have traveled 252/360 degrees. This will occur when 126 seconds have passed, since 252/360 degrees per second times 126 seconds is 252/360 degrees. The correct answer is 126 seconds.```"}

So it means that Bob will strike the drums every 9 seconds and cymbals every 12 seconds. So it is clear that every 12 seconds, Bob strikes the cymbals. It is also clear that every 9 seconds, Bob strikes the drums. So every 9 seconds, Bob strikes the drums and every 12 seconds, he strikes the cymbals. Every 36 seconds Bob will strike both drums and cymbals.\n\nThe time period between the striking of drums and cymbals will be 36 minus the least common multiple of 9 and 12.

{"question": "Henry and Margo both began traveling around a circular track. Henry is riding his bike, and Margo is walking. It takes Henry 7 minutes to make it all the way around, and Margo takes 12 minutes. How much time will pass until they meet at the starting line?", "correct answer": 84.0, "llm answer": "3.4 minutes", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\nAnswer: 3.4 minutes\n\nReasoning:\nHenry and Margo both start at the same time at the same place. Therefore, they move around the same circle at the same time.\n\nBecause they are going around the same circle, Henry is going 7/12 the speed of Margo. Therefore, when Henry travels around the circle once, Margo has traveled 12/7 times. Margo has traveled 12/7 times as much as Henry in the same time. This means that, in the amount of time Margo travels 12/7 times around the circle, Henry travels only once around the circle.\n\nThis means that in the amount of time Margo travels 12/7 times around the circle, Margo travels 12 times the length of the circle. Therefore, Margo travels 12 times the length of the circle in 12*7/7 minutes, which is 12 minutes. This means that the time it takes Henry to travel once around the circle is 12 minutes, which is 12/7 of the time it takes Margo.\n\nTherefore, it takes Margo 12*12/7 = 192/7 = 27 3/7 minutes to travel once around the circle."}

The reasoning process of getting the correct answer is highly similar to the reasoning process of getting the incorrect answer, but the incorrect answer can also show us some flaws in our reasoning process.\n\nLet's start by considering the answer and keywords:\n\n- possible answer: 78\n- keywords during reasoning to the possible answer: ['78 dollars']\n- keywords not in the reasoning process of this answer: ['30 dollars']\n- keywords that can be inferred: ['78 dollars']\n- keywords that can not be inferred: ['33 dollars']\n\nFirst, let's think about why the number '78' is a good answer. If we look at the keywords in our reasoning process, we should have keywords like ['33 dollars'] and ['45 dollars'], since those are numbers that were given in the question. This means that ['78 dollars'] can be derived from the other two numbers. If we also look at the keywords not in our reasoning process, we should not have keywords like ['30 dollars'], since we would not have needed to derive the keywords ['78 dollars'] from the keywords ['33 dollars'] and ['45 dollars'] if they were already in our reasoning process."}

How many birds did the pet store have total?", "correct answer": 77.0, "llm answer": "77", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nReasoning: \n1. The statement in the question provides the exact number of talking birds and non-talking birds. \n2. Since the number of talking birds and non-talking birds have no relation to each other, the number of talking birds and non-talking birds can be used as independent variables in an equation that helps determine the number of total birds.\n3. A good starting point would be assuming that the number of talking birds is 77. This is a logical choice because it is 77% of the total number of birds in the store (64).\n4. The statement that 13 birds do not talk suggests that the number of talking birds and non-talking birds together must be equal to 77. This suggests that the statement in the question is a contradiction in the problem.\n5. A contradiction means that the answer is not 77. Since the correct answer is unlikely to be 77, the answer is 77.\n```\nA simple mistake could lead to a huge deviation. For example, assuming that the number of non-talking birds is 77 will lead to an incorrect answer of 64.\n```Confidence: [100]%```"}

If five puppies a day are adopted,. how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "2 days", "confidence": 0.35, "probing response": "35%\n\nExplanation: If you adopt a dog, it can either be the 23rd puppy, which took 21 days, or one of the two new puppies, which only took two days. Assuming you're equally likely to adopt each dog, you have a 50% chance of adopting the two new puppies. That means the probability is 50% that the answer is 2 days and 50% that the answer is 21 days. You can also calculate the probability this way: 23 dogs + 2 dogs = 25 dogs. After you adopt 5 dogs each day, you have 5 * 21 = 105 dogs, which is 5 away from 110 dogs. You can divide this number of remaining dogs (110-105=5) by the number of dogs you will adopt each day (5 dogs/day) to get the number of days you need to adopt all the dogs, which is 5 days. If you adopt a dog, it can either be the 23rd puppy, which took 21 days, or one of the two new puppies, which only took two days.

How many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "3 cases of 12 boxes + 9 extra boxes", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: I think there are two ways to look at this problem. One way is to directly calculate with 45 boxes:\n```45 ÷ 12 = 3 + (45 - (3 × 12)) / 12 = 3 + 9 / 12 = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 => 3 cases of 12 boxes + 9 extra boxes``` \nAnother way is to divide 45 boxes into 3 cases:\n```12 × 3 = 36 boxes -> 9 boxes left -> 3 cases of 12 boxes + 9 extra boxes``` \nI think this question does not give enough information to make a decision.

Sean gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends (that is, 18 x (same number) = total number of Starbursts) --> Sean gave 2.5 x 18 = 45 Starbursts to his friends\n2. Sean then ate what was left --> Sean ate 45 - 2.5 x 18 = 0 Starbursts (i.e., none) \n3. 2.5 is a whole number, which means that Sean must have given one Starburst to each of his friends \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question must be 2.5.\n\n# This is a good question because it provides additional information about the number of Starbursts that each person eats.

Since we can't have half a skittle, we round down to 10 skittles that each person had, which is not the correct answer. But we also know that Samuel mentioned that he ate the left over, so we need to subtract 10 from 14 again. This gives us 14-10=4. Samuel mentioned that he had 4 friends, which is not the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is 2 skittles.\n"}

If she shares the blocks among 4 friends,. how many blocks does each friend get?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe first know that Laura shared her blocks with her friends and we know that there are 8 cards. As the blocks are shared among friends, it is likely that the blocks are distributed equally among her friends. Then, if we distribute 28 blocks evenly to 4 friends, each of them will get 7 blocks. This is a likely scenario as the answer is a multiple of 4, Laura has 8 cards and has 28 blocks. 28 divided by 4 is 7 and 7 + 8 is 15. Thus, it is likely that each of Laura's friends gets 7 blocks, so the possible answer should be 7. We then take this answer and check it by the criteria we have for our reasoning. For this scenario, we can check that Laura will have at least 4 cards and at least 4 blocks. Thus, it is likely that Laura has 28 blocks and 8 cards and that she shares her blocks equally with her friends, and therefore it is likely that she has 7 blocks.\n\nQ: How likely is it that 7 is the answer?\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 7 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include"}
