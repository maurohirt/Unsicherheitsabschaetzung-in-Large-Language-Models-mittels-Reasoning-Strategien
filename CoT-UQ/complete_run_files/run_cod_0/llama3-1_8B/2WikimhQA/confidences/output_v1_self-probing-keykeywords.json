If Aly Khan had one wife, it is likely that Aly Khan's wife is also Yasmin's mother. However, Yasmin's father Aly Khan had two wives.

The question specifically states that the grandfather was born in 1853. If I'm not mistaken, the year he died was actually 1933, not 1953 as the question says.

Also it mentions he is a contemporary of Justinian II, so he must have been born around the same time Justinian II was. This gives a range of possible birth years. Finally, it mentions he is a great athlete, which gives us a way to filter out dates when this activity was not common enough to be meaningful. In my opinion, this is around the time when Justinian II was emperor, and at the end of his life he converted to Islam, and that happened around 692, so I think this gives us the time range. Then we need to see which emperor's uncles are alive around the same time.\nWe see that from the list, we get:\n- Marcian, 450-457 CE\n- Justinian I, 527-565 CE\n- Maurice, 582-602 CE\n- Tiberius II, 574-582 CE\n- Justin II, 565-578 CE\n- Tiberius III, 698-705 CE\nI don't think the first one fits, because Tiberius II was around 300 years earlier than him, and"}
