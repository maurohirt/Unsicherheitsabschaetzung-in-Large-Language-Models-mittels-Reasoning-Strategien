A sibling-in-law is a brother- or sister-in-law, meaning a spouse of a sibling. So, William Stanley's sibling-in-law is the spouse of one of his siblings.\n\nWe know that William Stanley's siblings are Elizabeth, James, and William. Elizabeth was married to a man named William, James was married to a woman named Elizabeth, and William was married to a woman named Elizabeth. So, William Stanley's sibling-in-law could be either William or Elizabeth.\n\nWe can use the provided keywords to further refine our answer. Elizabeth was William Stanley's sister-in-law, so she could not be his sibling-in-law. James was married to a woman named Elizabeth, so he could not be William Stanley's sibling-in-law. This leaves us with William as the only possible sibling-in-law of William Stanley.\n\nHowever, the keyword \"William\" could also refer to William Stanley himself, which would not make sense in the context of the question. Therefore, the most likely answer is that William Stanley is the sibling-in-law of William Stanley."}

Since the question does not specify whether Aloys and his grandfather are on the same paternal or maternal line, we can infer that they are related through both.

Mahsida's name is used in the story to reference her, and when referring to the queen, she is called by her title. When the story begins, she is the wife of the king. However, when the king is killed and his son becomes the new king, Mahsida becomes a widow and her sons become the king's stepsons. This is supported by a sentence that says \"and when the king's stepsons came to the feast, the queen said to them, \"Be seated by my side\".\"\n\nThe story also mentions a stepson, Gulussa, being present during a ceremony to give gifts to the people. This suggests that Gulussa was born from the marriage of the king and Mahsida, as he was likely considered a stepson if he was born from a previous relationship of the king. Additionally, the queen is called the king's mother multiple times, further supporting that she was the mother of the king's stepson. In summary, Mahsida was the queen, the wife of the king, and the mother of Gulussa, making her Guluss"}

Axel's mother is 5 years younger than Axel's maternal grandfather, meaning the latter is at least 5 years older than 47, which is 52 years old. Next we can reason that Axel's mother is at least 5 years older than her brother, who is 36 years old. Axel's mother is 5 years older than 36, which is 41 years old. Axel's maternal grandfather must be at least 20 years older than Axel's maternal grandmother, which we can conclude by assuming Axel's parents are at least 5 years older than their eldest child, which is Axel's older brother. Axel's mother is 20 years younger than Axel's maternal grandfather, meaning Axel's maternal grandfather is at least 20 years older than Axel's mother, which we concluded is 41 years old, making Axel's maternal grandfather at least 41 + 20 = 61 years old.

So, his mother could not have died after the 1930s. Therefore, any mother born in the early 19th century is possible (such as the answer Ellen Fitzwilliam, born in 1815). This reasoning alone is enough to justify the 99.3% confidence.\n2) We can also use the keywords 'Helen' and 'Gladstone' to rule out other possibilities. 'Helen' could be the same person as Ellen, and it is reasonable that both 'Gladstone' and 'Fitzwilliam' could be mentioned in the same document, since both Gladstone and Edward's grandfather Fitzwilliam served as prime ministers of the UK (even if they were not at the same time). So, we can assume that this person 'Helen' is the same as Ellen. As for Gladstone, he was born in 1809 and died in 1898. Since Gladstone was alive in 1866 (when Edward"}
