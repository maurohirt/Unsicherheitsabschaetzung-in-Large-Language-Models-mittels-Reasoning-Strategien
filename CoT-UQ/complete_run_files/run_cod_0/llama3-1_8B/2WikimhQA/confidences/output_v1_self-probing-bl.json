Let's first analyse the last name Allégret, which is similar to Allegro. Allegro means fast, so the family members might be active. The first name Catherine is the feminine form of a masculine given name, so Catherine Allégret is likely a female. The word Allégret has a French flair, so Catherine Allégret likely has French origin. The word Allégret ends with an \"e\", so Catherine Allégret is likely a French person. French people are known for being passionate, so Catherine Allégret might be passionate. Catherine is a form of Catherine, which is a form of a masculine given name. Thus, Catherine Allégret is likely a masculine person. According to the above analysis, Catherine Allégret is likely a French person and a masculine person.

The historical timeline, especially in terms of genealogy is one of the easiest topics to understand and memorize since it's all linear, however you should take into account the fact that some of the dates and events can be forgotten quickly and that's why you should be using it as a base for your history study (you can use it to cross-check your facts).\n\nThis answer can be confirmed with the fact that the correct answer to the question, Regnar Iv is the paternal grandfather of Regnar Iv, Count Of Mons. Now it should be obvious that if one is Regnar Iv's grandfather, then he has to be Regnar Iv himself. And since Regnar Iv, Count Of Mons, is a son of Regnar Iv, Regnar Iv must be his father. And since there's no other Regnar Iv in the timeline, that leaves us with one Regnar Iv (the answer).\n\nSo why Regnar Iv's answer can't be confirmed? Well, the answer is simple, because Regnar Iv, Count Of Mons is not a son of Regnar Iv. The timeline tells us that Regnar Iv, Count Of Mons is a son of Regnar"}

So if we take into account that Constantine III was born in AD 1155, we can say that his uncle must have been born around AD 1135 (or slightly earlier). This narrows down the options quite a bit.\n\nThe next clue is that Constantine III is a \"king\". This means that he is not a member of the royal family by birth, but has been crowned as king. This rules out many potential uncles such as James III of Scotland, whose daughter was named as his successor after his death. It also rules out John Balliol, who was never actually king of Scotland.\n\nThe final clue is that Constantine III was an illegitimate child. This means that he cannot be descended from any of the legitimate lineages of Scottish royalty, which further limits our options.\n\nBased on these clues, I think the correct answer is probably \"I\" (the first option). This person was born around AD 1135, was not a member of the royal"}

As such, it's not a trivial task to identify which Goths we are talking about. So I'll just assume that they are the ones in France and then consider the remaining answers.\nFirst, the Goths were a Germanic people who ruled in Western Europe during the Dark Ages. In this period, the king of the Goths is a man named Godomar I (d. 486). According to The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he was succeeded by his brother, Gozegon. From this we can conclude that Cunegonde is Gozegon's mother and Godomar I's sister, as he had no other sisters.\nThe remaining answers are all stepmothers of the king of the Goths, who are also brothers. This narrows down the candidates to:\nCunegonde: This is the only answer that we know about, as she is Gozegon's mother.\nGozegon: This answer would make sense as Godomar I's brother, but it is unlikely to be correct as he was the next"}
