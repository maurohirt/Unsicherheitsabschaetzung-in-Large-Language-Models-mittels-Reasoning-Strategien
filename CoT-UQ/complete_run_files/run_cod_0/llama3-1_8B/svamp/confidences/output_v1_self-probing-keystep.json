With this information, you can solve for the mouse jumping 21 inches (42-3-33).\nThe probability of the grasshopper jumping 9 inches is 100%, since there was no prior information on its jump. The probability of the frog jumping 42 inches is 50% because there is a 50% chance of guessing right. The probability of the mouse jumping 21 inches is 33% because there is a 33% chance of guessing right. Adding the probabilities, we get the answer to be 33% (100%+50%+33%).\n\nThe formula in the format of \"100/(N+1)\" can be derived from the equation of expected value (in this case, 1/3+1/2+1/3=1).

Then we can add the number of cookies he bought to know how many he had in total. \n\n**Solution**:\n\nPaco had 40 cookies.\n\nPaco ate 2 cookies.\n\nPaco had **38 cookies** left.\n\nPaco bought 37 cookies.\n\nPaco had a total of **75 cookies**.\n\nI found the answer by adding up the number of cookies he had in the beginning, the number of cookies he ate, and the number of cookies he bought. \n\nThe number of cookies Paco had before he ate any were 40, and he ate 2, so he had 38 left. If Paco had 38 cookies left, he must have eaten 2 cookies, since we were told that he ate 2 cookies. \n\nPaco bought 37 cookies, so he had 75 cookies in total, after buying 37 and eating 2. \n\n**Confidence: 100%** I am confident this answer is correct.\n\n**Confidence: 100%** I am confident this answer is correct.\n\n"}

How many minutes did the machine work in all?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation: The key is that we know that the machine can make 8 shirts in one minute. There are a total of 16 shirts, and we know that yesterday it made 13, which means today it must have made 3 shirts. So we can make an analogy to \"minutes\" as the amount of shirts the machine made yesterday and \"today\" as the amount of shirts the machine made today. Since there are 8 shirts in one minute, if there are 13 shirts in \"minutes\" then it will take 13 \"minutes\" for the machine to make 13 shirts. In a similar manner, it will take 3 \"minutes\" for the machine to make 3 shirts. If there are 16 shirts in \"minutes\", it will take 16 \"minutes\" for the machine to make 16 shirts. There are two \"minutes\" in \"hours\" so 16 minutes is equal to 2 hours.\n"}

It is 95% likely to be correct. It is the result of the difference between the number of students suggested adding mashed potatoes (330) and those that suggested bacon (269).\n\nJustification: The correct answer is 61. It is 95% likely to be correct. It is the result of the difference between the number of students suggested adding mashed potatoes (330) and those that suggested bacon (269). The reason for my answer is that since the first part of the prompt asks Sofia to ask the students to suggest specific types of food, which is then followed by the question asking how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon. We are given three sets of students suggesting three different kinds of food. The most straightforward and logical conclusion is that the question is asking about the difference between the number of students suggesting mashed potatoes and those that suggested bacon. Based on the prompt, we can see that the total number of students that suggested mashed potatoes was 330. The total number of students that suggested bacon was 269. The difference is 330 - 269 = 61.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 61. The probability of answer 61 to be correct is 95%, because"}

She gives away 64, so there are N-64 games remaining. The question asks how many there are left, so the number of remaining games is the answer.\nThe only information the question gives us is that Kelly has 106 games. This is how many games she has before giving away any.\nThe only calculation we need to do is to add the number of games that she has before and the number of games that she has after. If she has N games before and M games after, we can say that N + M = 106.\nSo N-64+M=106.\nThis is because she has N games before and she loses 64 games, so she has N-64 games left.

How many cookies did Helen bake till last night?", "correct answer": 450.0, "llm answer": "720 cookies", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nIn fact, the most critical step in the above problem is that the question asks the number of cookies baked yesterday, not how many cookies were baked till last night. The answer of 720 is wrong, and the correct answer is 300. The reasoning of the answer 300 is that 419 + 301 = 720. The reasoning of the answer 720 is that the number of cookies baked yesterday (301) is less than the number of cookies baked today (270). The answer of 300 has a higher probability to be correct than the answer of 720. The probability of answer 300 to be correct is 100%.

How many planks does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2 planks", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: \n\n**Possible answer 2 planks**\nLet us assume the planks are nailed at both ends of the wall (length of the wall = L). Then the number of planks = L/(length of the plank). Let us assume the length of the plank is 4, so the number of planks = L/4. \nThe number of nails = the number of planks x 2 = L/4 x 2 = L/2.\nGiven that the number of nails = 4, we can say L/2 = 4. Hence the length of the wall is 8. Hence the number of planks = 8/4 = 2. The possible answer is 2 planks.\n\n**Possible answer 3 planks**\nThe reasoning is similar to the answer 2 planks but now, we are assuming that each plank needs 3 nails to be secured instead of 2.\n\n**Possible answer 4 planks**\nThe reasoning is similar to the answer 2 planks but now, we are assuming that each plank needs 4 nails to be secured instead of 2. \nTherefore, it is possible to answer 2 planks only.

From this information, we can conclude that the cost of the candy bar must have been the difference between these two amounts, which is $1. This is because if we subtract the money left from the total amount, we get the cost of the candy bar. For example, if Dan had $10 and left with $5, we can say that the candy bar cost $5. Similarly, if Dan had $20 and left with $10, we can say that the candy bar cost $10. In this case, the amount of money left after buying the candy bar was $3, so we can conclude that the cost of the candy bar was $4 - $3 = $1."}

What is the information that leads you to believe so?\n\nCorrect answer: 28\nExplanation:\n```Because the wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them is the same weight and the colors to paint the feathers are 49g, the wax that already needs to be added is 260g because if 49g of colors is added then 49g of wax needs to be added to keep them together. 260-49= 211 g. 288-211=77 g of wax needs to be added so 77+49= 126 g. But 49 is already added, so it leaves us 77 g of wax. If you know the answer is 28g, you can solve it by looking at 77/49=1.6, so 49x1.6=78, so if 49g is used then 28g is left, so that means that 28g of wax is left to be used.```\n\nPossible Answers:\n```28g\n52g\n24g\n18g\n"}

{"question": "Baker made 13 cakes. He sold 91 of them and bought 154 new cakes. How many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold?", "correct answer": 63.0, "llm answer": "154", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation:\n\nAnswer: 154\nReasoning:\nThe question says baker made 13 cakes, which means there are 13 cakes, which were bought, sold, and left. This means there were 13 + n cakes left. But the total number of cakes is 13 + 91 + 154 = 258. Therefore n should be 258 - 13 = 245. If we are going to add 245 to 13, we will have the exact number of 258.\n\nThe most critical step is counting the total number of cakes. If we can figure out the total number of cakes, we can calculate the number of cakes bought by baker.\n\nThe problem with \"13 cakes\" is that this sentence only describes the cakes that have already been sold. This sentence should have been written as 13 cakes made (or created) by Baker, which describes the total number of cakes made by Baker.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

The number of pens has to be 3 times more than the number of books because the amount of money spent on books is 4, and the number of books can be 4 because 4 times 4 is 16, which is more than 12. Thus, the number of books is 4 and the number of pens is 12 divided by 3. Therefore, the answer 5 pens and 4 books is correct.\nSo the critical reasoning step in the question leads us to the above reasoning step.\nThis reasoning step indicates that Edward spent 4 on books and 3 on pens. The amount of money he spent on pens is 1 less than he spent on books. Because the answer is about the number of pens and the number of books, the number of books has to be 1 more than the number of pens. The number of books can be 3 because 3 is 1 more than 2 and 3 times 3 is 9, which is more than 12. Thus, the number of pens is 3 and the number of"}

He left the park with 42 bottle caps. That means he found 13 bottle caps. That means that 13 bottle caps are missing from his original collection. He had 42 wrappers at the park and found 82 wrappers. That means he found 40 wrappers. That means that 42 wrappers are missing from his original collection.\n\nSo Danny has 42 bottle caps and 42 wrappers missing from his original collection. There are 29 + 42 = 71 bottle caps and wrappers in total missing from his original collection. There were 13 + 40 = 53 bottle caps and wrappers at the park.\n\nTo get to the 42 bottle caps Danny currently has, he must have had 71 − 53 = 18 bottle caps at the park to begin with.\n\nThe question is about danny and bottle caps, and it uses the words “at first” and “initially”. 18 is the only answer choice that fits the idea that he started with a few more bottle caps, not 42.\n\nNote that Danny’s “original collection” isn’t necessarily the only place where bottle caps came from.

The problem can be understood as there are now 706 girls and 222 boys in the school. I do not know how many students are there in total, but I know that if 418 girls joined the school, there must have been 706 girls already. Therefore, I have 706+222=928 students.\n\n2. The problem can be understood as 706+222 = 928 students. If 418 girls joined the school, there must be now 706+418 = 1124 girls. Therefore, the new number of students is 1124+222 = 1346.\n\nIt seems to me that the first method is more robust. It allows for some new boys to have joined the school, so the actual number of students may be slightly less than 1346, but not less than 928.\n\nThis question is a little confusing because it doesn’t specify that the girls were the only ones to join the school.\n\nHere’s what I understand from the question:\n\nIn the school, there are 706 girls and 222 boys, and then there is some other group of people.

The answer to the original question is the difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps (28-11=17). The answer to the rewording of the question is the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers (11-28=-17).

If we did that, we would get 2.514545. But that is not an answer option! If Frank read for 220 days straight without taking any days off, then he would have read 555/220 = 2.5 pages a day. But the fact that there are 5 chapters is information that gives us a clue that this is not correct. So Frank took 220 days off and read only 5 chapters. If Frank took 220 days off and read 5 chapters, then that means he would have read the equivalent of one chapter a day. One chapter should have 111 pages, so he should have read 111 pages a day. But the book has 555 pages and not 5x111 pages. That means that Frank read more than one chapter a day. How much more than one chapter did Frank read a day? We can figure this out by knowing how many pages he had to read over the 220 days. 555 pages / 220"}

A number close to 0 is low confidence. A number close to 100% is high confidence. ```\n```A1: Explain your reasoning. ```\n\nI am not quite sure if this is what you want, but here is my answer:\n\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: There were total crayons 492+52+535 = 1079.\n\nStep 2: Given that he lost 492 crayons. This means that he has (1079-492) = 587 crayons left.\n\nStep 3: Since he gave 52 crayons to his friends, the remaining crayons should be (587-52) = 535.\n\nStep 4: The total crayons in the box is (535+535) = 1070.\n\nStep 5: Hence the answer is 1070.\n\nHowever, the answer given is 975. I am not sure how it was calculated. If I assume that he gave away 52 crayons and lost 535 crayons, I get the answer 975, which is the answer given.

How many more green peaches than yellow peaches are in the basket?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nReasoning: The critical reasoning step has two parts, one part is that the number of green peaches must be greater than the number of yellow peaches, the other part is that the number of yellow peaches must be greater than 6 (because there are 6 yellow peaches). This leaves only one possible number for the number of yellow peaches: 7. Then the number of green peaches must be greater than 15 (because 7 + 15 = 22, which is greater than 14). This leaves only one possible number for the number of green peaches: 15. Then we calculate the difference between the number of green peaches and the number of yellow peaches: 15 - 7 = 8.

If the question had asked about the difference between candies and chocolates, it would have been necessary to take into account the candies consumed as well.

With 11 feet length, 15 feet width and 16 square feet of carpet already covering the floor, the most critical step of the reasoning is:\nMore carpet: 165 - 16 = 149\nIf we do not get this critical step, it is difficult to understand why answer 149 square feet is correct.\nI think the key point here is not whether you can arrive at the correct answer, but whether you can follow the steps to understand why the answer is correct. This is why I think it is important to show your reasoning.\nThe critical reasoning in the question is that we should first find out how many square feet carpet that the whole floor needs. Then, the answer should be the difference between the two numbers: the whole floor area and the square feet carpet that Jesse already has.\nWith the floor 11 feet long and 15 feet wide, we need to find out the floor area.\n11 feet x 15 feet = 165 square feet\nHowever, Jesse already has 16 square feet carpet.

The two ratios 1.23/1 and 1.25/1 are pretty close (0.02). It’s also similar to 2.46/2. In other words, the ratio 1.23 is in the neighborhood of 1.25 and 2.5. This helps to estimate the likelyhood of answer 150601.\nThe estimated likelyhood that the number is in the neighborhood of 1.25x is 1/4 = 25%. The estimated likelyhood that the number is in the neighborhood of 2.5x is 1/2 = 50%. If we combine the two estimates, we get 25% + 50% = 75% + 25% = 100% = 1, which means there is a 100% likelyhood that the answer is either 1.25x or 2.5x, or somewhere in between (including 1.23x). Since 150601 is in between 1.25x and 2.5x, we get the likelyhood of 150601 is the correct answer is 100%.\nNotice that it"}

But we can still do it manually, step by step as follows.\nStep 1: We start with the given information:\n    - Total number of books is 134 books.\nStep 2: To answer the question, we need to find out the number of books sold.\n    - Given that Paul gave 39 books to a friend.\n    - That means, the number of books sold = 134 - 39 = 95 books. (Since total number of books - given number of books = sold number of books)\n    - But the question says that Paul had only 68 books left after selling some books.\n    - Hence, number of books sold = 95 - 68 = 27 books.\nStep 3: Now we can answer the question.\n    - Number of books sold in the garage sale = 39 books.\n    - This is the only possible answer.\n\n````"}

I think the cookies must be more or equal to 60 in total. If there are only 15 sweet cookies and 56 salty cookies, there must be less than 15 sweet cookies, maybe 3 or 4, because Paco only eats 15 sweet cookies and it can not be 60. There must be at least 3 or 4 salty cookies, but 56. So the total can not be 60. Maybe there are at least 58 cookies. Maybe there are at least 60 or 61 or 62 or 63 or 64 cookies.

{"question": "The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?", "correct answer": 11210.0, "llm answer": "10798", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\n```\nThe number of students in the school must be a multiple of 118, the number of students on a school bus. If we assume that there are m buses, then the number of students in the school is m*118. For m=91, there are 10798 students in the school, and for m=92, there are 10876 students in the school. If we calculate the ratio of these two numbers (m=92/m=91=1.09), we find that a 9% increase in the number of buses results in an approximately 9% increase in the number of students in the school. This is a relatively high probability, so we assign a confidence level of 90%.\n```"}

How many pencils does she have?", "correct answer": 720.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: \n```Because each row contains 71 crayons and 24 pencils, I can multiply 71 by 30 to get 2130 and multiply 24 by 30 to get 720. This means there are a total of 2130 + 720 = 2850 objects in 30 rows. The 71 + 24 = 95 objects in each row is a distraction, because I need to consider the 2850 objects. There is no way to know from the information given whether Faye was distributing pencils and crayons in 30 rows or 30 different piles, so I don't know if she had 24 or 71 pencils. For the number of pencils, 24 is the only possible answer that fits the 2850 number. So I think 24 is the only possible answer for how many pencils she has, so I would give it a 100% confidence that the answer is 24.

Then it gets cut off 20 inches, so it becomes 2 inches long. \n* Alternatively, if we look at the difference between the amount of cut off hair (20 inches) and the amount of hair it grows (8 inches), we see it is 12 inches. So 12 inches of hair gets cut off. This leaves only 2 inches.\n* Thus, the answer is 2.\n* This is reasoning with the additional information that the critical reasoning step is to cut off hair.

Well, we all know how to do simple math. So we should be able to figure it out right away that the answer is no.\nThe next step, given that Edward bought books for $16, how many books did he buy? Let's try 35 books at a time. This is because the only factor of 16 that is greater than 7 (which is the number of books we have to buy) is 8. And if he buys 8 books, then he will need 4 books for the last $2. But this is a number (4) that is less than 7, so let's go with 8.\nWhat about the remaining $6? Well we need 7 books so we need the remaining $6 to buy another 2 books. This gives us 35 books in total. So the answer should be A.\n\nWhat if I buy 12 books? Well then, we need another 2 books and $8 left to buy those 2 books. So, $16-$8 = $8 is left. Now we have a total of 14 books and $8 left"}

How long is his hair now?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17 inches", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50% \nExplanation:\n```In this question, we are given that Robin’s hair was 16 inches long, he cut off 11 inches, and then his hair again grew by 12 inches. The question asks us to determine how long Robin’s hair is now.\nSince we are not given any other information, we can only assume that Robin’s hair has grown 12 inches since he cut it off. Therefore, his hair is currently 16 + 12 = 28 inches long.\nHowever, this answer is not one of the options, so we need to consider another possible answer. The only other answer choice is 17 inches. Since Robin’s hair was initially 16 inches long and he cut off 11 inches, we know that his hair is currently 5 inches shorter than it originally was. Therefore, his hair must be 16 – 5 = 11 inches shorter than it was when he initially cut it. However, we are told that his hair grew by 12 inches, so his hair is currently 12 + 11 = 23 inches long. Therefore, the correct answer is 23 inches.```"}

It could have been formulated more clearly.\n\nYes, it's a bit vague but that's part of the exercise.

Why 21,664? The equation to get the number of t-shirts is: $ \\frac{38,748}{86} = 21,664$. To get 21,664, multiply 254 by 86. 86 is how much profit they made off each t-shirt. This is the same concept as getting the total price if you know the item costs $ 1 and you know you bought 5 of them.\nOnce you know the total number of t-shirts, you can plug that into your second equation: $ 38,748 - 21,664 \\times 86 = 11,664\n\nSo we know that they sold $ 11,664 t-shirts, and they sold"}

{"question": "Rachel has 52 apple trees. She picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees. Now the tree has 7 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n\nIn this critical reasoning task, Rachel's tree was originally assumed to have 52 apples, but the answer is actually 12. In the given task, Rachel picked two apples from one of her trees, and now there are seven apples still on the tree. Based on this information, the critical reasoning step is to determine the number of apples that the tree originally had. This step can be calculated using subtraction as follows:\n```2 - 7 = -5``` \nThis means that Rachel's tree had originally 12 apples. In other words, the tree originally had 52 apples, and now it has 40 apples left after Rachel picked two apples.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the confidence of the answer being correct can be calculated as follows:\n\nConfidence: 50%\n```1 - (1 / 52) = 50%``` \n\nIn this task, there were 52 trees and Rachel picked two apples from one of them. This leaves a probability of 1 / 52, which is the same as 1% chance of picking the correct answer. Therefore, the confidence of the answer being correct can be calculated by subtracting 1% from 100%, which results in 50%."}

{"question": "There were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\nExplanation:\nSince there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses, the difference between final rose count and final orchid count is 1 more than the difference between initial rose count and initial orchid count (6 - 20 = -14 and 22 - 21 = 1). There were more roses than orchids before the cutting, so it is more likely that roses were cut than orchids. The answer of 2 more roses than orchids is also not correct, so the answer must be 1 more rose than orchid. The probability of this to be correct is (1-10%).\n\nI had thought it was more likely that orchids were cut than roses since there were 6 roses and 20 orchids before the cutting and there were 21 orchids and 22 roses after the cutting. But my reasoning seems to be wrong according to the hint of 'considering this critical reasoning step as additional information'. Maybe the first question about which answer to choose is different from the question about the critical step in reasoning, so my reasoning for the first question is not necessarily correct for the second question. The only reason I can think of to choose a higher probability for the rose to be cut is that there were 22 roses"}

The only answer with 33+28 and 5 less than 33 is 28, not 21. Thus,  I had to change my answer from 49 to 61.

How many tickets did Dave have left?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\nThere are two ways to solve this problem: the more general one is to count tickets (using \"maths\") and the more common one is to use pictures (notation) and rely on the concept of zero.  The latter is used here.\n1. We have 18 tickets in all. Dave used 5 tickets to buy some toys, and another 11 to buy some clothes.\n2. Therefore, we can count 5 + 11 = 16 tickets, and the remaining tickets is 18 - 16 = 2.\nIf we want to count the tickets, this problem is not very difficult, but if we want to draw the pictures, it will be more difficult. We need to remember the concept of zero.\n\nWe start from the arcade.\nWe start from 18 tickets, then use 5 tickets to buy some toys.\nAfter 5, there are still 18 - 5 = 13 tickets. We can draw a line to indicate that 5 tickets are used to buy toys.\nUse 11 tickets to buy some clothes.\nThere are still 13 - 11 = 2 tickets left.\n\nWe can draw pictures to represent the problem.\nSo the remaining tickets is 2, and the answer"}

If the students are evenly distributed, there would be 120/5 = 24 students per classroom.\n\nIf there are 84 seats in the school bus, 84 students can be seated in the bus, assuming each seat is for only one student. Since there are 24 classrooms and 120 students in the school, 120 / 24 = 5 students per classroom.

Please first show your reasoning concisely and then answer with the following format:\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 52 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 2%\n\nExplanation:\nWe know that there are 66 pages in each book, and it takes 12 days to read each book. Therefore, the total number of pages is 66 × 12 = 792 pages. We also know that it takes 492 days to finish all the books, so each book takes \\(\\frac{492}{N}\\) days to finish, where N is the total number of books.

How many grams of wax does he already have?", "correct answer": 331.0, "llm answer": "25 g of wax", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: Considering the total number of wax and feathers. We can say that the wax needed to stick the feathers together is equal to the total weight of feathers, which is 353 grams. Since 22 grams of wax will be required to paint the feathers, 25 grams of wax is needed to stick the feathers together. Therefore, the total weight of wax needed is 25 grams, which is our answer.\n\nExplanation: First, we need to convert the mass to weight. Since 1 gram is equal to 0.0352739619 ounces, 353 grams is equal to 12.42 ounces. Now, we need to calculate the total weight of wax needed to stick the feathers together. This can be done by multiplying the total weight of feathers by the amount of wax required to stick them together, which is 22 grams. So, 12.42 ounces of wax is needed to stick the feathers together. Finally, we need to find the total weight of wax required to paint the feathers. This can be done by multiplying the total weight of feathers by the amount of wax required to paint them, which is 57 grams. So, 6.84 ounces of wax is needed to paint the feathers.
