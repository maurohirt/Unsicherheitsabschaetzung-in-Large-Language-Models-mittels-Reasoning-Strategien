{"question": "43 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some children got off the bus. Then there were 21 children left on the bus. How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22 children", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\nPossible Explanation: The probability of getting 22 children to leave the bus is lower than the probability of the other children. If there are 21 children left on the bus, then there must be less than 23 children that got off the bus. Also, it's not 1 because there are less than 21 children left on the bus.\n\nQ: How does the confidence of the answer change if we replace \"less than\" to \"at least\" in the question:\n```[21 children] were left on the bus. At the bus stop [22 children] got off the bus.```\nConfidence: 50%\nPossible Explanation: In this case, 22 children leaving the bus is likely because it's more than or equal to 21.

{"question": "28 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 82 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 30 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "80", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: The key of this problem is to count how many more children got on the bus than those that got off. There are two ways to do that: 1. Subtract the number of children at the bus stop before the bus arrived at that stop and the number of children at the bus stop after the bus arrived. 2. Subtract the number of children at the bus stop before the bus arrived at that stop and the number of children on the bus at the same time. By the rule of reasoning, we must first identify the keywords and then make reasonable judgment on those keywords. We found two keywords: 1. There were 30 children altogether on the bus after some children got on the bus and some children got off the bus, and 2. There were 82 children got on the bus at that stop. However, we found that this question cannot be solved by keyword substitution method. Therefore, we must solve the problem using mathematical method. Now that we have identified the keywords, we will make reasonable judgment on these keywords. From the second keyword, we can know that the total number of children in the bus at the bus stop is 30. However, according to the first keyword, we can know that the total number of children"}
{"question": "There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "49 - 3", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nReasoning:\nOlivia had 3 dollars and collected 49 more. This means Olivia had 52 dollars initially. Then Olivia spent 49 dollars at the supermarket. This means Olivia had 3 dollars after she visited the supermarket. The difference between Olivia's wallet amount and the amount of dollars she had left in the supermarket is 52 - 3, which is 49. Therefore, the possible answer, 49 - 3, is correct.\n\nI think this is a good reasoning, and it seems right to me that 49 - 3 should be the correct answer. However, I have very low confidence in my reasoning because I don't see a pattern in the process of reasoning to the possible answer. Also, I don't know why this is possible answer rather than other possible answers, such as 49 - 3 - 49, 49 - 49, etc. I think it may be because the difference between 49 and 3 is 49 - 3, and this difference is the same as the initial difference between Olivia's wallet and the amount of dollars she had left after she visited the supermarket.

If the waiter had 21 customers at the beginning, it means that the waiter had 10 more customers than he had at the end. There were 9 customers who left, so if we subtract 9 from 10, we get 1.\nSince the question asks how many customers did the waiter have at the start, if we add 1 to 12 (number of customers the waiter had at the end), we get 13.\nTherefore, the waiter had 21 customers at the beginning.\n\nQ: The question above is a multiple-choice question.

Each table has 13 chairs. If we take 1 table out, we have 10 tables with 13 chairs. Then, we put back the first table. We will have 11 tables with 13 chairs. That makes 11 tables. However, it doesn't matter if we put back the same table. We can do the same reasoning with the second table out. The result is the same.\n\nIn general, we put a table out and then put it back.

The first thing I thought of is \"Ron is 4 feet shorter\" which leads me to \"the difference in height between Ron and Dean is 4 feet\". However, I didn't realize that the question itself had the clue that the difference between their height is 4 feet. If I had read the question properly, I could have noticed the clue and then reasoned that \"since Ron is 13 feet, Dean must be 17 feet, which means Dean is 17 feet + 13 feet = 30 feet\".

How many birds are sitting on the fence?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "18", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n\nExplanation: \"4 more birds\" and \"8 more storks\" are both \"more\" and so they could be combined into \"more birds and storks\", making it 6+more = 12, so answer 18 is the only possible choice\n\nExplanation: From keywords, we know the situation involves \"6 birds\", \"4 more birds\", and \"8 more storks\", and we know we want to count the total number of birds and storks on the fence. We might try \"6 + 4 + 8 = 18\". But that would give us a total of 18 animals, which are birds and storks, but not the total number of birds. Then we might try \"6 + 8 = 14 + 4 = 18\". Now we have the total number of birds (14) and storks (4), but we're missing the total number of animals. Then we notice that \"more birds\" and \"more storks\" are both \"more\", so they could be combined into \"more birds and storks\".

At the end of the year, he only had 523 crayons left. If he did not lose any erasers, then he should have 457 + 617 - 523 = 551 erasers left. So it should be correct that Paul has 551 erasers and 523 crayons left. But to simplify the calculation, I just round it to 550 and 525 erasers and crayons left.

Now the first step would be to list out the possible combinations of 19 movies and 16 books. The total number of possible combinations would be 19C19*16C16 which gives us 19!/(19!*0!)*16!/(16!*0!) = 19*16 possible combinations.\nThe next step would be to find the possible combinations where there are more movies than books. There are 4 cases for this:\n19 movies, 0 books\n18 movies, 1 book\n17 movies, 2 books\n16 movies, 3 books\nThe total number of possible combinations in these cases would be:\n4C4*16C16 = 4!*0!/4!*0!*16!*0!/16! = 4*16 = 64\nThis means that we have 19*16 - 64 = 280 - 64 = 216 possible combinations where there are more books than movies.\nNow, the question states that the answer is 1.

Let x be the number of cups Mary has put in. She put in some cups, meaning she put in at least 0 cups, so we need to make sure that x is greater than or equal to 0. She also needs 2 more cups of flour, so we need to make sure that x is less than 12-2 = 10.

How many customers does he have now?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n```\nReasoning: The key is to make sure `12 - x` does not change by 2 (which is the number of customers who left). This is because we are trying to figure out the value of y (`10` new customers). \n\nAs we know `12 - x + y = 12 - x + 10`, then `y` must equal `10` (or we would not get the `12 - x + 10` part). However, `12 - x + y = 14` (our goal). So we know that `14 - 12 + x = 10`, or `x = 2`. Therefore, `y = 10`. Our final answer is `12 - x + y`, or `12 - 2 + 10 = 22`. So we can be very confident that this is the answer.```\n\n---\n\nQuestion: 2/6 cups of water are needed to mix with sugar for a new recipe.

(2) Paco must have less than 40 cookies in total, since he already eat 5 cookies. (3) I think the answer should be 37, but the given answer is 22. 37-13=24. Therefore, 22 should be right, because Paco must have given more cookies to his friend.  The reasoning here is: Paco eat 5 cookies, and gave 13 to his friend. He must have less than 40 cookies, otherwise it wouldn't make sense. Since Paco gave more cookies to his friend than 13, the answer must be 22, because Paco didn't eat all the cookies and he didn't give all the cookies. He must have less than 40 cookies. Paco didn't give 13 cookies to his friend, therefore, Paco must have given more cookies than 13 to his friend.

How many campers went rowing in the afternoon?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning: Since in the problem statement it is mentioned some more campers went rowing, so this makes the afternoon rowing > morning rowing.\nAlso there is no other possibility other than 17. So it must be the right answer.\nThe reason being the morning rowing was 15 and then some campers went. In case the afternoon rowing was greater than 17, there would be additional campers who did not row in the afternoon.\nFor example if the afternoon rowing was 18, there would be 3 campers who did not row in the afternoon.\nI am guessing if you are a math person you would see the above reason. It is very subtle but correct."}

She now has 15 fishes left. We need to figure out how many fishes disappeared. We can use deductive reasoning to solve this problem. \nWe know that there are 7 goldfish and 12 catfish in Paige's pond, so we can write that as: 7 + 12 = 19. We also know that stray cats ate them, so we can subtract this number from the total number of fishes to get the number of fishes that disappeared: 19 - 4 = 15. Therefore, 4 fishes disappeared.\nThe possible answer is 4 because it is the correct answer given by the author of this problem."}

How many apples did Rachel pick in all?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\n**What you might have done?** Considered 29 - 7 = 22. 4 x 22 = 88, so the answer should be 22. However, you are not sure why.\n\n**What you should have done?** Since this is a multiplication question, you might consider Rachel picked total 7 x 4 = 28 apples and she picked a total of 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 = 35 apples. So she picked 35 - 28 = 7 apples more. \n\n**Explanation**:\nIf we look at the numbers in the question: 7, 29, 11, 4, we can see that the 4 is the largest one. And this is our key to solve the question: if there are 4 apple trees, and each apple tree has 7 apples, then how many apples do we get if we multiply 7 x 4. 7 x 4 = 28. The question said Rachel picked 7 apples from each of her trees, so how many apples did Rachel pick in all?

How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0.0%\n\n\nExplanation: I assumed that there are 2 types of birds: storks and birds. I thought that each of the 2 original birds were storks, and the other 5 birds were birds. Thus, the total number of birds is 2+5, which is 7. Similarly, the total number of storks is 2+4, which is 6. Hence, there are 3 more birds than storks. \n\nHowever, the problem states that \"there are 3 more birds than storks.\" So, there must be a total of 8 birds (7 birds+1 stork), and a total of 5 storks. This means that the two original birds are storks, not birds. Therefore, there are 2 more birds than storks. This is not the correct answer, as the problem states that there are 3 more birds than storks.\n\nTo summarize, the problem is not clear, and the answer is not certain. I am uncertain if the answer is 2 or 3. Therefore, I chose 0% as my confidence level.\n```Confidence: 0.0%```\n"}

How many bananas does he have in his collection?", "correct answer": 26180.0, "llm answer": "26140", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\n\nExplanation: \n\nTo figure out the answer, we can first try to think about the keywords. The keywords are not very useful here. The only useful one may be 140 which can be thought as a \"group of 187\". The key to solve this problem is to do a rough estimation based on the given information.\n\nIf there are 140 groups of 187 bananas, that would be 140*187 bananas, which can be 140 * 100 + 140 * 87 = 14000 + 12092 = 56092, which is not the answer.\n\nTherefore, we should think in terms of tens and twenties. If there are 187 bananas in a group, that is almost 200. If there are 140 groups of 187 bananas, that would be almost 140 * 200 = 28000.\n\nThe answer 26140 is correct, the reason is:\n(1) 26140 is the only one divisible by 187. The answer is also divisible by 140, which means the number is also divisible by 10 and 7, which means the number should be divisible by 70, thus the last digit must be 0.\n\n(2) If the number is greater than 200"}

The difference of the number of peaches between Jake and Steven is 12, which indicates that Jake has 19-12=7 more peaches than Steven.

There are 8 movies and 21 books. The answer is the total amount of movies/books minus the amount we read/watched. Therefore, we have to find the answer for 8*21 - 7*4.\n7*4 = 28\n8*21 = 168\n168 - 28 = 140\nSo the answer is 140, which is wrong. Therefore, we have to find the answer 18. So we have to minus the 18 with the answer that we already got, 140 - 18 = 122.\nThat means there are 122 movies/books, so the remaining movies must be 21 - 122 = -101, which is impossible. So 18 is the correct answer."}

So it can be 0, 1, 2,... We can't just take 9 and 4 directly. If we do so, the number of marbles will be 9 - 4 = 5. It is not a natural number.\nWe know that the number of marbles left is a natural number. So it can be 0, 1, 2,... We can't just take 9 and 4 directly. If we do so, the number of marbles will be 9 + 4 = 13. It is not a natural number.\nThe two numbers should be adjacent. For example, if 9 - n = n + 4. There are two numbers that fit the condition: 0 and 13.\nSo the number of marbles lost is 13. But the problem says it is a natural number, so the number of marbles lost should be 0.

How many more chairs than tables do they have?", "correct answer": 117.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n\nComment: Since they want more chairs than tables, there are two possible choices that satisfy this condition: either 13 tables or 14 tables, and for each choice, 9 extra chairs can be put on the table. So they have the same probability to choose one of the two choices.\n\nFor example: When the number of tables is 13, the total number of chairs is 13*14 + 9 = 197, which is larger than the total number of chairs when the number of tables is 14, which is 14*14 + 9 = 193. Therefore, the probability is 0.5 that they choose 13 tables, and 0.5 that they choose 14 tables."}

How many total shelves did his room have?", "correct answer": 80.0, "llm answer": "0.2", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\n\nExplanation: The question is worded in a way that does not give a clear indication of the relationship between the number of figures per shelf and the number of shelves in the room. The keyword \"8 figures\" is most likely a typo and should be replaced by \"8 shelves\" to correctly interpret the question. In that case, the number of shelves is calculated by dividing the number of figures by the number of figures per shelf. So, the answer is 0.2. However, the keywords \"10 figures\" and \"8 figures\" could indicate that the question is asking for a comparison of the two numbers, in which case the answer would be 0.8. This interpretation is less likely because it does not match with the original question, but it cannot be excluded without further context."}

Therefore the correct answer is 2.\n\nIf answer above is correct, reasoning: \n- The above answer says that there are more cups of sugar than salt in Mary's cake.\n- Let's assume that we have 6 cups of flour and 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt, so we have 1 cup of flour left.\n- Now we can calculate how many cups of sugar and salt are needed to make the cake.\n- 1 cup of flour is equivalent to 2 cups of sugar or 1 cup of salt. So if we want to have 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of salt, we need to add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of salt to the cake."}

The keywords were just too much for the brain to figure out which answer they correspond to, leading to a total blank.

(answer 3 seems to be an answer which contains similar keywords to 5) Therefore, the brain thinks the correct answer must be answer 3.\n\nThe keywords in the question are so abundant that the brain can easily ignore one of them. Since Ryan spends 7 hours on learning chinese and 6 hours on learning english, the keywords ['1 * 5 days = 5 hours'] are much more likely to be ignored than the other keywords. And if the brain were to focus on the keywords ['1 * 5 days = 5 hours'], it would still be difficult to pick the right answer out of all the similar keywords.\n\nI think that the reason the keywords ['1 * 5 days = 5 hours'] are so abundant is that they contain a"}

For example, one could interpret the phrase 466 pots to mean that there are 466 unique pots. However, there is also another reasonable interpretation that there are 466 copies of a single pot. One could interpret the phrase 53 flowers per pot to mean that each of the 466 unique pots has 53 flowers. However, it could also mean that the 53 flowers are distributed among the 466 unique pots. One could interpret the phrase 181 sticks per pot to mean that each of the 466 unique pots has 181 sticks. However, it could also mean that the 181 sticks are distributed among the 466 unique pots.

How many rows could she make?", "correct answer": 70.0, "llm answer": "70", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Explanation: Faye has 70 pencils which is 35 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 4 pencils. Faye wants to put 2 pencils in each row. So if Faye wants to put 2 pencils in each row then she needs to have 35/2 = 17 rows. But each pack of pencils has 4 pencils so if Faye wants to make a row with 2 pencils then she needs to take 2 packs of pencils. This means that 4 pencils are needed to make one row of 2 pencils. There are 70 pencils so the number of rows is 70/4 = 17.5 rows which can't be 17 rows so Faye has 18 rows of 2 pencils. This means that Faye has 35/2 = 17 rows which is 18 rows if there are 4 pencils in each row.

So 1 and 3 must be the 7th number, and they are obviously wrong. The answer is definitely not 7.\n\nThe 7th number in each number can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So let's first write all the 7th number in the number. 1, 3, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6.\n\nNow we know there are 1, 3, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6 as the 7th number. The sum of them is 36. The total sum of all the numbers is 6,138. We"}

{"question": "A waiter had 3 customers. After some more arrived he had 8 customers. How many new customers arrived?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nThe first part of my reasoning is that the first sentence says 'After some more arrived...' which means it is implied that there were some already there. Since the number of people in the second sentence is 8 it is not obvious to me how this works without adding more people. My initial thought was 5 (since 5+8=13 and there were already 3 people) but since it was not given which of those 8 customers were new and which were existing, there are multiple ways that this can work. 3+1+5=9, 3+3+5=11, 3+2+6=11 etc. This was my reasoning why I thought it was a 50/50 chance."}
{"question": "Brenda's mother made cookies for guests. If she prepared 38 cookies and each of them had 19 cookies.

But the answer doesn't say that, it says 19 cookies means each cookie had 19 cookies. This means 19 * 19 = 361 cookies. If there were 38 packages of cookies, that would be 3610 cookies. But she only made 38 cookies, and 3610/38!= 361.\n\nI think the answer is 1, because 1 guest eats 38 cookies, 2 guests eat 19 cookies, 3 guests eat 12 cookies, 4 guests eat 9 cookies, 5 guests eat 7 cookies, 6 guests eat 6 cookies, 7 guests eat 5 cookies, 8 guests eat 4 cookies, 9 guests eat 4 cookies, 10 guests eat 3 cookies, 11 guests eat 3 cookies, 12 guests eat 3 cookies, 13 guests eat 2 cookies, 14 guests eat 2 cookies, 15 guests eat 2 cookies, 16 guests eat 2 cookies, 17 guests eat 2 cookies, 18 guests eat 2 cookies, 19 guests"}

To figure out how many bottle caps he had at first, we need to subtract the number of old bottle caps that he threw away from the total number of bottle caps that he has.\n\nDanny threw away 60 old bottle caps, so we need to subtract 60 from 67 to get the number of bottle caps that he had at first. 67 - 60 = 7, so Danny had 7 bottle caps at first.\n\nThe correct answer is 7.\n"}

If 13 kids leave, there will be 1 kid who stays home, and that doesn't align with the given information. So, 1 - 150601 = -150600.

If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that. How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day? There are three days involved in the story, including the one before that day. Then, we know that 419 + 92 + 103 = 614, which is also equal to 327 + (how many visitors were the day before that day). We can solve for the missing number by subtraction. 327 - 614 = -287, which means that the day before that day, there were -287 visitors. This cannot be correct, since we know that no negative number of visitors can be a correct answer. Therefore, there were actually 327 - (-287) = 614 visitors before that day.\n```"}

Thus, we should use the information that the number of visitors on the previous day is 100 and 666 on that day.\nConsidering that the answer is correct, the difference of the number of visitors between the previous day and that day is 566, which is the absolute value of 666 - 100 = 566. Thus, the answer should be 566.\nAlso, the difference is \"How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?\", so it should be positive value.\nTherefore, the answer is likely to be correct and the probability is 70%."}

So it is equally likely that the second chapter is first, last, or middle. So if 13 pages are added to 68 (the length of the second chapter), then it is equally likely that there are 81 pages in the second chapter, or 91 pages in the second chapter, or 81 pages left in the first chapter.

I made 3 connections so far: ['167-44', '61-44', '123'] from 3 keywords. We know 167 is larger than 61, and also we know 61 is larger than 44, so we can conclude 167 is larger than 44, thus '167-44' is correct. Similarly, I know 167 is larger than 61 and 167 is larger than 123, therefore 123 has to be larger than 61, thus '123' is correct. Then I got two correct answers and just need to fill in the blanks with a random combination, which gives me a 25% confidence. Then I realized that 61-44 is the most straightforward combination, so I got another correct answer and boosted my confidence to 50%.

{"question": "The Razorback shop makes $ 62 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 99 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?", "correct answer": 11346.0, "llm answer": "$ 5,001", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation:\nAs given, Razorback shop makes $ 62 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 99 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 183 t-shirts and 31 jerseys. To find the money made by them, multiply the number of shirts with $62, and multiply the number of jerseys with $99. Then add these two numbers together to find the total money made. To solve this, use the formula: \"m * x\" (multiplied by), where \"m\" is the multiplication factor and \"x\" is the variable. Thus, you get the following answer: (183 x 62) + (31 x 99) = $ 5,001.\n"}

{"question": "Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "6.5", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\n### Reasoning:\nThis is a partitive division word problem and Marco's strawberries are the \"whole\". However, because the problem gives a total amount of strawberries rather than a unit amount, I am going to use a formula of `total - unit = part` and then divide both sides by `total` to get `1 - unit/total = part/total`. `unit/total` is the fraction of Marco's strawberries, so we want to find the difference between 1 and that fraction, or `1 - unit/total = part/total`. We are given the total strawberries and the whole, so we will need to divide 30 pounds by 47 pounds to find `unit/total`, which is `30/47 = 6.3839838383883845`. Then, we subtract 1 from this to get `1 - 6.3839838383883845 = -5.3839838383883845` and then we multiply that by the total, which is 47 pounds, to get `-5.3839838383883845 * 47 = -253.0749933840823` and the answer is that the strawberries Marco picked weighed 253.0749933840823 pounds less"}

Since we don't know anything about Jason's finances over the course of the week, we'll assume that $41 of that $60 is still in Fred's pocket.  In this case, Jason washed cars over the weekend and now has $33.  To determine how much money Jason made washing cars, we can subtract the money he had last week from the money he has now.  So we'll start with $33.  From there, we can subtract $19, the money Jason had last week, and we're left with $14.  In other words, Jason made $14 washing cars.  The answer is Jason made $14 washing cars.```\n\n```Confidence: 100%```"}

To solve the problem, we can start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities. For example, let us assign a variable $x$ to represent the cost of each book. Then, the cost of two books can be written as $2x$. Now, we know that Edward spent $6 to buy two books and he now has $12, so we can write two equations:\n\n- $2x = 6$\n- $12 = 6 + 2x$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can substitute the value of $2x$ from the first equation into the second equation. This will give us:\n\n- $12 = 6 + 2x$\n- $12 = 6 + 2(2x)$\n- $12 = 6 + 4x$\n- $12 - 6 = 4x$\n- $6 = 4x$\n- $1.5 = x$\n\nTherefore, each book costs $1.5$.\n\nThe question asked \"how much did each book cost?\" which is the same as asking for the value of $x$. Therefore, the correct answer is $1.5$."}

How many more campers went rowing in the morning than in the afternoon?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "40", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\nReasoning to the answer:\n\nSince the word \"more\" appears in the sentence, we can think that it means \"the number of people is different between morning and afternoon\" or \"the difference between morning and afternoon is greater than 0\".\n\nIn this case, we can assume that the difference between morning and afternoon is greater than 0. Then, the difference must be greater than 26 because 26 people went rowing in the afternoon. Hence, the difference between morning and afternoon must be greater than 26.\n\nSince we don't know the value of the difference between morning and afternoon, we should eliminate the answers. The value of 95 is much bigger than 26, which makes the answer wrong. Then, we can eliminate the answer of 95. Next, we compare the answer 40 to the answer 55. The value of 55 is greater than 40, which means the answer of 55 is wrong. Hence, we can assume that the correct answer must be 40.\n\nHowever, if we do not have enough knowledge about how to solve this kind of problem, we cannot easily find the answer.

There are 252 rows, and it takes 2 hours to check one row, so it would take 252 times 2 hours to check every row. It would take 12,960 minutes to check every row, so the amount of grapes that the pickers would fill in one day is 12,960 minutes divided by 108 drums, which is 120 minutes. Therefore, it would take 57 times 120 minutes to check every row, and in 58 days, they would fill 14,960 drums. There are 6 more drums in the 58th day, and if the pickers work 14,960 hours a day, the number of drums will be 14,960 times 6, so there would be 14,961 drums in 58 days.\n\n"}

The question asks \"How many more apps did he add than he deleted?\" We know that he started with 21 apps, so he added 89 - 21 = 68 apps. Then we know that after deleting some apps, he had 24 left. Therefore, he deleted 24 - 21 = 3 apps. Finally, we can calculate how many more apps he added than he deleted by subtracting the number of apps he deleted from the number of apps he added: 68 - 3 = 65 apps.

How much money does he earn during harvest season?", "correct answer": 1054997.0, "llm answer": "30,799", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: We first calculate the income of working overtime every week:\n`$$30,799=28*1091+939*(1091-1)$$`\nThe answer of 30,799 is correct.\n\n# I would guess that the correct answer is $30,799, based on the following reasoning:\n- Lewis earns $28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest.\n- He also earns $939 per week for working overtime.\n- If he works overtime every week, his total income would be $28 + $939 = $967 for each week.\n- Therefore, his total income for 1091 weeks would be $967 * 1091 = $1053977.\nHowever, I am not sure if I have correctly understood the problem statement.\n\nIn my previous answer, I had calculated the total income for 1091 weeks, but the correct answer is only for the harvest season, which is 1091 weeks. So, the correct answer would be $967 * 1091 = $1053977.\n\nIt seems that the original question did not specify whether Lewis earns overtime income during the harvest season or not. If he does not earn overtime income during the harvest season, then the correct answer would be $967 * ("}
