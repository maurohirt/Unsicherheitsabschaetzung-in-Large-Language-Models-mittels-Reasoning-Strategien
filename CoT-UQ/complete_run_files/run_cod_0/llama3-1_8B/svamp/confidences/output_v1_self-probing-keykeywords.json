We can say Danny has 22 bottle caps at the park and 30 wrappers at the park. Then, Danny collected 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers, giving him a total of 39 bottle caps and 87 wrappers. We can solve this problem by using the method of proportions. This means that we can set up a proportion to compare the number of wrappers Danny had at first to the number of wrappers Danny has now. The number of wrappers Danny had at first will be the unknown variable, so let's label it x. We know that 22 out of 30 wrappers are in Danny's collection, so we can write: \n(22)/(30)=(x)/(x+17)\nWe can multiply both sides of the equation by (x+17) to solve for x:\n(22)(x+17)=30x\n22x+374=30x\n22x-30x=-374\n-8x=-374\nx=46.75\nTherefore, Danny had 46.75 wrappers at first."}

{"question": "After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day.

How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?", "correct answer": 949.0, "llm answer": "703*24/246", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: \n\n`703*24/246`\n703 is a product of 246 and some other number.\nThe `703*24` term implies that the other number must be less than 24. \n`24/246` is roughly 10%, so the other number is about 10% of 24.\nThe other number must be less than 24 but also between 1 and 10% of 24.\nOnly 2 is such a number.\nTherefore, the product must be `703*2`, or 1406.\n\nA good way to find the answer by inspection is to convert 246 to powers of 2. Since 246 = 2^3 * 31, 703 is 2^6 * 31 and 24 is 2^3 * 3. Therefore 703*24 is 2^9 * 3 * 31. So the final answer must be a multiple of 2^6 * 31 = 1406.

To find out how many books remain, we have to take the total number of books, which is 14, and subtract the number of books read so far, which is 8. This leaves us with 6 books left to read.\n\nAnswer 2: 3 books left to read\nReasoning: This is not the correct answer as it is based on the assumption that the books in the'crazy silly school'series are all of equal length. However, this is not the case as the series consists of different books that vary in length. Therefore, the answer should be based on the total number of books in the series, which is 14.

Therefore, let's label this variable as `x`.\nWe know that the number of files left after deletion is 21. Hence, after Dave deletes the files, he will have 21 files. \nSo, `x` files will be removed from the 24 files he started with. This means that `24 - x = 21`. Then, `24 - x = 21`. \nAfter adding `21` to both sides of the equation, we get `24 - x + 21 = 21 + 21`. Now, it can be reduced to `45 - x = 42`. Then, `45 - x = 42`. \nWe want to isolate the variable `x` from the equation. Hence, we add `x` to both sides of the equation to obtain `45 - x + x = 42 + x`. This can be reduced to `45 = 42 + x`.

How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "4 feet", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n```\nExplanation:  The book was 112 pages, and took Frank 16 days to finish. That means Frank read 112 / 16 = 7 pages a day. 7 can be written as 2 * 3 + 1. Therefore, Frank read 4 feet per day (not 3 feet per day, but 4 feet per day). \nSo the possible answer is correct.\n\nHowever, if we look at the keywords, none of them matches with the situation we encountered. In order to make use of keywords, we have to identify the relationship between keywords and possible answer. For example, in the above example, the keywords ['2 * Width', '8 = 2 * Width'] indicate that we can get 4 feet from 8 by multiplying 2 with 1. Therefore, the correct answer is 4 feet. \n\nOverall, keywords provide additional information which can help us reason better, but they require some effort to identify their relationships with possible answers. If you are new to this kind of question, try out some examples first before answering them.\n```"}

There is a total of 16 + 18 = 34 peaches per basket, which means there are 6 \\* 34 = 204 total peaches. We know that 16 of them are red, which means there are (204 - 16) / 18 = 10 green peaches.\n\nSo if we're just going off the numbers in the question we can get the answer 16 red peaches, which is the right one, so I'm giving it a confidence of 70%.\n\nBut the keywords do give us some additional information which we can use. The first keyword is that we're asked to consider the baskets of peaches, not just the peaches in general.

As a problem that combines these two fields, this question also raises several challenging problems and presents the first step in building a general solution.\n\n## The Logical Reasoning Problem\nThe logical reasoning problem is to determine whether a question has a single correct answer. There are several strategies for doing this, including using a set of heuristics or making use of the answer set. In this question, there are four possible answers to the question: A, B, C, and D, which are labeled as [‘1’, ‘70’, ‘5’] and [‘5’, ‘70’]. Each answer has a probability of being correct, which is calculated from the sum of the answer values. These probabilities are 1/7 for the first answer, 2/7 for the second answer, and 3/7 for the third answer.\n\n## The Natural Language Processing Problem\nNatural language processing is used to parse the question and extract the keywords from the question. In the example question, the keywords are [‘5’, ‘70’] and [‘5’, ‘70’]. These keywords are also used to help find the answer.\n\n## Building the Solution\nThe"}

How many pages does the book have altogether?", "correct answer": 125.0, "llm answer": "125 pages", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```\nReasoning:\nThe book has three chapters, so the sum of the pages in the three chapters is the number of pages of the book.\n66 pages is 3 times 22 and 35 is also 5 times 7, so the sum of 66 and 35 will be divisible by 7, so the sum will be either 101, 108 or 115. It can't be 115 because that is not divisible by 3.\nThe number of pages in the book can't be less than 66 + 35 = 101 because there must be at least one chapter more than 24 pages, and there are 66 pages already. It can't be 108 either because that will make 24 chapters more than 7 pages each, which is not possible.\nThe number of pages in the book can only be 125 because that will give 3 chapters more than 41 pages each, which is possible.\n\nExplanation: The reasoning can be divided into two parts, the first part is how the number of pages in each chapter was estimated, and the second part is how the sum of 66 and 35 is 101, 108, or 115.\nTo determine the pages in each chapter, the"}

How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "15 pounds", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nComment:\nFirst of all, I am a little confused about how much data this kind of question contains, e.g. the statement \"Marco's strawberries weigh 19 pounds\", which includes two values: the value of his strawberries and the weight of dad's strawberries (implicitly 4 pounds). So in my reasoning I have to include the data from both the question and the possible answer. \nMy reasoning: Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. So 4+19=23. His dad's strawberries must weight 23-19=4 pounds. However, in the answer option it says his dad's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, so it's not the correct answer. Since it's not the correct answer, I have 50% confidence. \nI'm not sure if this is how I am supposed to do this, and I'm sorry if I confused you guys.

{"question": "Carol was sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends. If each package of invitations she bought had 2 invitations in it. How many packs does she need so that no friend gets left out?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Explanation: Carol will need 5 packs of invitation to send each friend one and avoid any of the 10 friends being left out.```\n\nQ: What if the question above has a possible answer of 6, instead of 5, as the correct one. How would your reasoning and the confidence be different?\nAnswer: The possible answer should be 5, not 6. If Carol sends 5 invitations in each pack and has 10 friends, then she needs to send 10/5 = 2 packs. Each pack has 2 invitations. Therefore, Carol should need 2*2 = 4 invitations to send each friend one invitation. She does not need to send 10 invitations because there are 10 friends, as it would be redundant. If Carol has to send 10 invitations, then it would mean she needs to send each friend 2 invitations in the 2 packs. If there are only 10 invitations and 10 friends, then it would mean she needs to send only 1 pack with each friend getting 2 invitations. Therefore, the correct possible answer should be 5, not 6.\n\nQuestion: Given a set of images with labels 1-10, what is the best possible 2"}

This kind of revelation is called an accidental or accidental discovery. On the other hand, innovation is when someone invents something that has never been seen before. Innovation is deliberate, intentional, and creative.\nFor example, the first man who found a dinosaur fossil was revealing an ancient discovery, but the scientist who made the idea for a nuclear bomb was an innovator because he had a brilliant idea that had never been thought of before.\nWhen we talk about an innovation or an invention, we are usually talking about a physical object, such as the first computer or the first mobile phone.

We can then use this proportion to determine the amount of sugar that needs to be added. From the keywords, we can see that 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar have already been added, so we can use the proportion to calculate the amount of sugar that needs to be added to the mixture. Dividing 14 by 5 gives us 2.8, which means that for every 2.8 cups of sugar added, 5 cups of flour are also added. Since 10 cups of flour have already been added, we can subtract this from the total amount of flour in the desired recipe, which is 5 cups. This gives us 5-10= -5 cups of flour. To find the amount of sugar that needs to be added, we can divide this by the ratio of 2.8, which gives us 5/2.8 = -1.8 cups.

For example, I can assume that all boys play marbles and all of them like to play at school, in which case the answer is 7. But if I assume that all boys play marbles, but not all of them like to play at school, the answer is 4. I can also assume that some boys don't like to play marbles at school and some boys don't play marbles at all. This will result in the answers being 2, 3, 5, 6, or 8.

{"question": "Paul got a box of 253 crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 70 of them. How many crayons did he have left by the end of the school year?", "correct answer": 183.0, "llm answer": "183", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0.0%\n\nPossible reasoning:\nWe can use some properties of integers to reason that the answer is likely to be correct. First, the total number of crayons, 253, is odd. Second, 253 is a multiple of 11 (i.e., 253 = 23⋅11). Third, the total number of crayons lost or given away, 70, is also odd. Fourth, 70 is not a multiple of 11. \n\nWe can use these properties to deduce that there is no solution to the problem. The reason is as follows. Suppose we add the total number of crayons lost or given away, 70, to the answer to the problem. The result will be an odd number, and will also be a multiple of 11. In other words, it will be an odd multiple of 11. This means that the answer to the problem must be an odd number that is a multiple of 11, and thus the problem cannot be solved. Therefore, the answer cannot be correct.\n```"}

Junk mail would be 48 pieces of junk mail, And then he wants to know, he wants to give 48 pieces of junk mail to each of the 81 blocks.

Since the problem says \"If she prepared 18 cookies and each guest had the same number of cookies\" then there are 18 / 14 = 1.3 guests who did not come, which is not an integer, so Brenda's mother must have given the 14 cookies to 1 guest.\n\nQ: Did you notice any problem in your reasoning or have doubts about some keywords?

{"question": "Baker made some cakes. He sold 145 of them. If he still has 72 cakes left. How many cakes did baker make?", "correct answer": 217.0, "llm answer": "145", "confidence": 0.01, "probing response": "1%\n\nExplanation: If we know that there are 72 cakes left, we can use this information to find the number of cakes that the baker made. First, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes left. This will give us the number of cakes that were not sold. We can then add the number of cakes sold and the number of cakes not sold to get the total number of cakes made. In this case, we know that there are 72 cakes left. So, we can subtract 72 from the number of cakes sold to find the number of cakes not sold. Since the number of cakes sold is 145, we can subtract 72 from 145 to get 73. This means that 73 cakes were not sold. We can then add the number of cakes sold and the number of cakes not sold to find the total number of cakes made. This gives us 145 + 73 = 218. So, the total number of cakes made is 218. This means that the baker made 218 cakes in total.\n\nExplanation: If we know that there are 72 cakes left, we can use this information to find the number of cakes that the baker made.

How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?", "correct answer": 745.0, "llm answer": "21565", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation: \n\nSince the keywords are only about the number of visitors, we should only focus on the number of visitors.\n\nIf the number of visitors before is 188, and there are 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace, then the average number of paintings seen per person per day is 71/188. For the other 56 days, Rachel would have seen 71/188 paintings on average for 56 days, which is 71/(188 * 57). There are 557 visitors in total in a day, which means the average number of paintings seen by a person on a single day is 71/(188 * 57) * 557. This means in the 57 days, the total number of paintings seen by a single person is 71/(188 * 57) * 557 * 57, which is the possible answer 21565.\n\nSince the average number of paintings seen by a person on a single day is not 1, we can infer that the answer 21565 is unlikely to be the correct answer, which means the probability is less than 50%.

Thus, there are two steps to solve it. 1) Subtraction; 2) Checking and explaining. The keyword is to check, not just solve. Therefore, we have to use logic and reasoning to solve the question and explain how we do it. The reason of asking why we should subtract is simple. Because the question clearly states that Lucy bought 23 packs of cookie. Thus, 23 packs is removed from the total amount. In this way, there are only 27 - 23 = 4 packs left. If the answer is correct, we can get 4 packs of cakes. Thus, this answer is correct.\n```"}

How many more hours does he spend on learning english than he does on learning chinese?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3 hours", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nReasoning: Since there are 10 hours in a day, and the total number of hours in the question is 18, this means Ryan has to learn 8 hours in the day to be \"balanced\". This means he spends 1 hour more on english than he spends on chinese, since english is 6 hours and chinese is 3 hours. Therefore, english should be 3 hours more than chinese, and the answer is 3 hours.\nConfidence: 100%\nReasoning: Given all of the information stated in the question, it is evident that Ryan spends three more hours learning English than he does Chinese. This is because he spends a total of 6 hours learning English, while he spends 3 hours learning Chinese. Therefore, the difference between these two amounts is 6-3=3, which is the correct answer.\nConfidence: 100%\nReasoning: Ryan spends 6 hours learning English, 3 hours learning Chinese, and 5 hours learning Spanish. To figure out how many more hours Ryan spends learning English than he does learning Chinese, we need to subtract the time spent learning Chinese from the time spent learning English. This gives us 6-3=3 hours. Therefore, Ryan spends 3 more"}

Otherwise, it's impossible to answer the question.\n\nLet's look for the first chapter's page number.\nIf the page number is x, there's a certain ratio between the two chapters: 2x/11. That's because the first chapter has x pages and the second chapter has 2x/11 pages.\nThen, we multiply this ratio to the second chapter's page number to get the first chapter's page number.\nSince we're looking for 37, we calculate 2x/11*11=22. This means the first chapter has 22 pages. And the second chapter has 11 pages. The answer is 37 which is the difference between the two chapters. \nThis question is tricky because the answer could be \"we don't know\" but in order to be right, we must give a definite answer.

{"question": "Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had 10 bags of cans. She found 3 bags of cans on the next day and 7 bags of cans the day after that. How many bags did she have altogether?", "correct answer": 20.0, "llm answer": "20", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation:\nThe first sentence of the question provides an initial number of bags of cans collected. It is not immediately obvious whether this information is important, as the question does not refer to this specific number. \nThe next sentence gives a new number of bags of cans collected, which is again not immediately relevant for answering the question.\nIt is important to consider the relationship between the bags of cans collected in the two statements. The word \"found\" indicates that the number of bags of cans in the second sentence is a new addition to the previous number of bags of cans. The word \"next\" further clarifies that this addition refers to the next day after the first statement was given. Therefore, the number of bags of cans collected after the second statement is also three more than the number of bags of cans collected after the first statement. \nWith this understanding, it becomes clear that the final number of bags of cans is three more than the number of bags of cans collected after the second statement. \nThis is equivalent to three plus the sum of three and seven, which is equal to three plus ten. \nTherefore, the answer is twenty.\n"}

For example, I will think it is not correct when I see the frog jump 35 inches in the last sentence because in math it must be 65 inches not 35 inches and hence I conclude it is not correct.)\n```\n\n**Hint:** A reasonable upper bound of the confidence level is 95% and a lower bound is 50%. The closer to 95%, the more confident you are.\n"}

We can assume that there are 11 customers at the restaurant, and then subtract the number of remaining customers. By looking at the two numbers 11 and 3, we can see that 11 - 3 = 8, which means that 8 customers left and 3 stayed behind.

How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?", "correct answer": 23.0, "llm answer": "6.5", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n- My reasoning: First, the only reason for 13 trees died is that there were 13 trees in the backyard. Thus, we know 13-3=10 trees were grown initially and 13-10=3 trees survived. Then, I got the total number of trees that died as 13-3=10 and I divided it by 10 to get 0.6. Then I converted it to percentage, 0.6*100=60%. However, the probability should be less than 60%, as there might be a mistake in the calculation (maybe the person misread the information or the calculation was not completely correct). To be on the safer side, I assumed the maximum error was half a tree, which is 3.5 trees. So 3.5/10=0.35, and 0.35*100=35%. 35%<60%, so 60% is the upper bound of the probability and 40% should be the lower bound. \n\nI think there are two parts in this problem: the part I can solve, which is to find out the trees died in the typhoon and the part I cannot solve, which is to know how many trees were grown in"}

The given information is that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven, and 18 more peaches than Jill. The solver must use this information to find the number of peaches that Steven has, and then compare it to the number of peaches that Jill has.\n\nThe solver should start by setting up an equation that represents the information given. This equation could look like this:\n\nJake - Steven = 9\nSteven - Jill = 18\n\nFrom here, the solver should solve the first equation for Steven, and then substitute that value into the second equation. This would give them the number of peaches that Steven has. Finally, the solver should compare this value to the number of peaches that Jill has, and report the answer.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is that Steven has 9 more peaches than Jill. To show how to arrive at this answer, the following steps are shown:\n\nJake - Steven = 9\nJake = 9 + Steven\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nJake = 9 + Steven"}

We also know that there are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection, and we want to figure out how many groups that is, so that we can divide the 7.97 candies per group by that number of groups and get the answer in terms of skittles. The problem says \"the erasers are organized into 495 groups,\" so this tells us that there are 495 groups, or in other words, 4950 erasers, which is how many we already know.

This information is used to determine the number of grapes that would be filled in 77 days. The worker is trying to estimate the number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 77 days by using the information provided by the 235 pickers.

The worker was told by 235 of the pickers that they fill 100 drums of raspberries per day and 221 drums of grapes per day.

He has 13 left. So, 54-X = 13. I think this means he sold 54-13, or 41. Since I was asked for the most likely answer, I took 41 and multiplied it by 5. 41 x 5 = 205.

How many blocks are left?", "correct answer": 54.0, "llm answer": "54 blocks", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: To reason to the answer above, I can use logic of operations. It's similar to how we use PEMDAS or BODMAS to solve mathematical expressions. Here, I can use POMDAS. P stands for parentheses (grouping) and O stands for Order of operations (multiplication and division from left to right). A stands for Addition and S stands for Subtraction. From the question, we can see that \"14 blocks\" is within parentheses (grouping) while \"11 blocks\" is not. From there, I can conclude that the order of operation is 14 * 11, which is 154, then subtract the whole number, 79 - 154 = 54, which is the answer that makes most sense and fits the question, Randy has only 79 blocks in total, not more than 79 blocks.\n\nQ: Considering these keywords as additional information, how likely is the answer above to be correct?

Then he spent 7 hours learning chinese everyday so 5 days in a week, so 5 * 7 = 35 hours spent learning chinese. Finally, he spent 3 hours learning spanish every day, 5 days in a week, so 5 * 3 = 15 hours in a week. Now adding the three together, we have 30 + 35 + 15 = 80 hours in a week. \n"}

Therefore, the number of birds in total on the fence should be greater than 2. Therefore the correct answer is greater than 2, and 4 is the largest answer choice and thus correct.\n```Explanation: Considering the information from the keywords (not considering any other info), my probability that the correct answer is 4 is 0.6 and the probability of it not being 4 is 0.4.

If the total number of pieces of gum is 42 and there are 3 pieces of gum in each package, we can divide 42 by 3, which will give us 14. However, since the question asks how many packages Robin has, 14 may not be the correct answer. We need to reason that this answer is not correct because if we start with the total pieces of gum and then divide by the number of pieces in each pack to get 14 packages, there would be a remainder of 2. We know that there are not going to be 2 pieces of gum left because Robin said that each package had 3 pieces in it.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 14 to be correct, not"}

Thus, we know that the number of bags harvested must be equal to the number of bags discarded plus the number of bags discarded. This gives us the equation number of bags harvested = number of bags discarded + number of bags discarded. We can rewrite the left hand side of the equation as 76 (number of bags harvested), and the right hand side as 64 + 64 (number of bags discarded), because we know the number of bags discarded is 64. Thus, we have 76 = 64 + 64, which simplifies to 76 = 64 + 64. Finally, we have 76 = 64 + 64, which simplifies to 76 = 128. This gives us our final answer, 76 = 128.\n\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 76 * 50 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 0%\n\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 76 * 50 - 64 * 50 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 20%\n\n"}

It is possible that there are other types of units or there might be no unit at all. We need to think of the keywords.\n\n2. For the keywords, I noticed there are two numbers that I can get a ratio of and the other two are results of subtraction. I think the numbers might be related with each other, because all of the numbers are integers. It is very likely the answer is a multiplication or division.\n\n3. I tried to calculate the ratio of 14 and 8. I realized the result is a fraction number, so the answer might be a multiplication of the numbers. The numbers are 14 and 8, 14 is the greater number, so the answer might be a multiple of 14.\n\n4. The keywords have two numbers and two subtraction results. I thought the numbers might be the numerator and denominator of a fraction and the other two might be the result of a multiplication and division"}

How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "16", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem we can simply subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate from the total number of sweet cookies he had. Similarly, we can subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the total number of salty cookies he had. Then, subtracting the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he ate, we get the answer.\n```Keywords during reasoning: ['20 - 8 = 12', '34 - 6 = 28', '28 - 12 = 16']\nAnswer: 16```"}
{"question": "A grocery store had 79 bottles of regular soda, 53 bottles of diet soda and 42 apples. How many more bottles of regular soda than diet soda did they have?", "correct answer": 26.0, "llm answer": "26", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nKeywords during reasoning: ['53 bottles', '79 bottles']\n```Possible Answer: 26```\n\nExplanation: The first thing I notice is that the question asks how many more regular soda bottles than diet soda bottles there are. I don't think this information affects the calculation much since I believe it's equivalent to asking how many more total soda bottles there are compared to diet soda bottles, but maybe I'm missing something. \nAnother thing I notice is that we're given a total number of each type of bottle (79 for regular, 53 for diet). This makes sense because we want to know how many more bottles of regular soda there are compared to diet soda, so the total amount of both types of bottles needs to be known. \nFinally, we're given the number of apples. This seems like a weird detail, but I think it's important because the apples could have been used in place of some of the regular or diet soda bottles, so knowing how many apples there are helps to determine how many soda bottles there might be."}

Then the second statement tells us that if 7 of the old ones are removed, the new total will be 10. 17 - 7 = 10. This means there were 17 action figures before. So adding 2 new ones would make the new total 17 + 2 = 19. However, the question tells us the total now is 10. Therefore, Jerry must have taken away 9 action figures before adding 2 more.

Second, she played tag with 12 more kids on monday than on tuesday. This second piece of information is not specific to the answer 16, which means this piece of information can be true for any other answer too. This means the second piece of information is redundant.

However, in the question, we are told that there are 290 bananas in total. Therefore, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups of two, which gives us the ratio of 290 bananas to 2 groups of two, or 145 bananas to 1 group of two.

How many more pastries than cakes did baker make?", "correct answer": 112.0, "llm answer": "61", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\nTo see that this answer is correct, we know that he has made total 151 items (19 cakes + 131 pastries), and then he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, that is 158 items in total. So, there are 151 - 158 = -7 items left, i.e., there were 7 items missing. As he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries, then the total items he sold is 158, which means there are 7 items missing. So, 7 items missing means 7 pastries are missing, and 4 cakes are missing, and then total items missing are 4 cakes and 7 pastries, that is, 4 cakes and 7 pastries more than 4 cakes.

Therefore, 98 cakes divided by 4 friends equals 24.5, which would mean the remaining 1.5 cake would not be divided equally. The answer is then 32.\n```Additional comments or any other remarks you would like to make:```\nThis problem is slightly complicated because we need to calculate the leftover cake, which is 1.5.\n```Additional information that might be important:```\nMath problem.\n\nI am not very good at this, but I believe the answer is 32 crackers and 98 cakes.\n```Explain your reasoning:```\nIf I understand the question correctly, Matthew gave each friend the same number of crackers and cakes.

So \"Fred\" is the boy who is making money over the weekend. The answer also has \"Fred\", so it seems to be the answer to this question.\n- From \"Last week\", we can assume that Fred earned no money last week.

So we can eliminate this answer.\n- \"Jason\" has no relation to Fred in the question. But we can assume he is a boy who has 95 dollars last week. Since \"Fred\" is the one making money over the weekend, and we have excluded 33 dollars, it is possible for the answer to be 218 dollars, because Fred earned 90 dollars over the weekend, and he already has 33 dollars, so he has 33 dollars last week.\n- \"95 dollars\" is the money that \"Jason\" has last week, which means he has no relation to Fred's earning over the"}

So I assumed that they would have harvested 26 × 28 sacks of ripe oranges in 26 days. \nFor the unripe oranges, I assumed that it would be the same logic as the ripe ones. So I assumed that they will harvest 26 × 52 sacks of unripe oranges in 26 days. \nSo adding up the number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested in 26 days, it will be 26 × 28 sacks of ripe oranges + 26 × 52 sacks of unripe oranges. \nTherefore, I assumed that the total number of sacks of oranges they would have after 26 days of harvest would be 26 × 28 sacks of ripe oranges +"}

Therefore, Jason's initial amount is 52 dollars. Then from the question statement, we know that Jason now has 33 dollars, so we can then directly apply the formula (x2 - x1) = x4 to the \"33\" and \"52\", which gives 33 - 52 = x4, thus x4 = 33 - 52 = -19.
