We know Mrs. Hilt used 8 large marshmallows and 10 mini marshmallows. We need to calculate the total number of marshmallows she used.

The question is asking how many friends can't go to the movies. To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of combination.\n\nA combination is a way of selecting items from a group, such that the order of selection does not matter. In other words, a combination is a subset of a set. In this case, we're trying to find all possible ways to select 8 friends from the set of 15 friends. Since the order doesn't matter, we can use the formula for combinations:\n\n$$nCr = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$\n\nWhere n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items we're selecting. In our case, n=15 and r=8. So, we have:\n\n$$15C8 = \\frac{15!}{8!(15-8)!} = \\frac{15\\times14\\times13\\times12\\times11\\times10\\times9\\times8!}{8!\\times7\\times6\\times5\\times4\\times3\\times2"}

However, since the reasoning process is not correct, the confidence score for this answer should be very low, which is 30%."}

The question mentioned Robin had 18 pieces before\n2. Robin's brother gave her more pieces\n3. Robin has 44 pieces in all\n\nFirst, we can determine the difference between the current amount of Robin's gum and 18. The amount is 44 - 18 = 26 pieces.\n\nThe question did not state whether Robin has the original 18 pieces and got more pieces. In other words, Robin could possibly have 0 piece of gum before she got the pieces from her brother.\n\nBy looking at the keywords, we can say that Robin's brother gave her more pieces. Hence, she must have had some gum before her brother gave her more. The keywords'some' and'more' suggests that she has more than 0 piece before her brother gave her the gum. In order to obtain the current amount of gum, the difference between the current amount and the number of gum before Robin's brother gave her pieces must be equal to the number of pieces given by Robin's brother.\n\n```The possible number of gum Robin has before her brother gave her gum:\n    0\n    1\n    2\n   ...\n    26\n```\n```The number of pieces Robin's"}

You may include mathematical derivations or any other logical reasoning here.\nIf we start with 88 on Tuesday, we're looking for the decrease of 8 on Monday. We can then get the solution of 80. This process is similar to subtracting 8 from 88, except the 8 is removed, instead of taken away.

How coins could I have on minimization?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "2 quarters and 1 nickel", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\n### Explanation\nLet's consider each coin type as a random variable taking value 0 or 1 indicating it being present in our hand or not. For example, if I have a penny in my pocket, the random variable corresponding to the penny would have a value 1. As I only have 2 cents left after removing the 28 cents, it is highly likely that at least 1 of the coin types is not present in my pocket.\n\nWith a bit of reasoning, the total probability of not having any coin type is given by $0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75$. Let's denote this random variable as $X = X_p + X_d + X_n$ where $p, d, n$ denote the penny, dime and nickel respectively.\n\nWe also know that 1 coin of each type is present in the possible answer with probability $0.125 + 0.125 + 0.125 = 0.375$.

So even if the question tell us 30 cookies, the answer is still not enough. There could be more people eat more cookies. If the question asks the total amount of cookies eaten, then the answer will be \"60 cookies\". I'm guessing the team should know more info that the question does not mention. However, the second question does mention that they ate 30 cookies. So the answer is correct and 30 cookies.```"}

Firstly, there is no information that the aviary only shows eagles, not other birds. Thus, the count of 65 eagles does not mean that all the birds in the aviary are eagles. Secondly, the information given does not provide a total count of birds in the aviary. The 65 eagles could be less than a third of the total birds in the aviary. This means we can not conclude that the number of eagles is 65. Thus, this reasoning is not valid.\n"}

Here are my reasoning:\n- If the aquarium contains sharks, eels, and whales, Penny could only count different species of those 3 animals.\n- From the given data, we can see that the total number of animals is 55. Therefore, the number of whales must be less than or equal to 10 (because whales' species is at least 1, and 55 - 35 - 15 = 5 - 1 = 4)\n- However, Penny can identify only 5 different species of whales, not more than that. This makes the answer less likely.\n\nI think the answer is 65. The possible keywords are '10' and '5'. We can infer that there are 10 different species of sharks, 5 different species of eels and 5 different species of whales. The sum of the number of different species of animals is 10 + 5 + 5 = 20. The number of species that Penny can identify is 65 (55 - 20).\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 65 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: "}

The reasoner should not think about it in a hard, linear way of removing 39 bug species from the 98 bug species, as it is hard to do so mentally. Instead, a more efficient way of thinking is to imagine if we have 0 bugs, and we add 98 and 39 bugs, then the amount of bugs should be 137. So we just need to find 137 minus 98, which is 39, which is the number of bugs we donated. \n\n# How I think about this problem?\nIn this problem, the possible answer is 59. When I first read the question and checked the keywords, I realized the problem is about subtractions. Since we're not given a very long problem, I could not find much keywords from the question. So my first step was to reword the question into a math problem: ```98 bug species minus 39 bug species = how many bug species left?``` Then I reworded it into a math equation: ```x = 98 - 39``` I knew that 59 is the difference of the two numbers, so I chose 59 as my answer.\n\nThis way of solving"}

We don't know the information of the total number of factories. But we do know the number of factories that the first group and the second group checked. And this is enough to solve this problem. I'll first create a mathematical model. We know that the first group checked 69 factories and the second group checked 52 factories. That means they have checked a total of 69+52=121 factories. And we know that 48 factories remain unchecked, and we can get this by deducting 121 from 169. Thus, 169-121=48. In this way, I believe the answer is 48.\n\nI believe the above reasoning to be true with a confidence of 80%.

(2) The money could be used to invest in infrastructure and other public projects, which would create jobs and boost economic growth. (3) The money could be used to reduce taxes, which would give consumers more money to spend and stimulate economic activity.

The price of the boat ride is per mile, so the price for the trip should be $320 (8 per mile x 40 miles). Since we can only use the information in the question, we can't use any of the keywords. We know that the cost of the boat ride is 8 dollars per mile and we know that they travelled 40 miles. We do know the cost of the ride, but we don't know the cost of the ride for 40 miles. To find the cost of the ride for 40 miles, we need to multiply the cost of the ride by the number of miles. In this case, we can use our keywords and multiply the cost of the ride by the number of miles. The cost of the ride for 40 miles is $320. Our answer is 320.\nConf"}

The tradition of hanging a sock above the fireplace for each family member suggests that the number of cinnamon balls used should match the number of family members. This means that if she hangs a sock for each of her 5 family members, she should use 5 cinnamon balls per day for 10 days (50 cinnamon balls total). However, the question asks how long she can do this if she bought 50 cinnamon balls, so the total number of cinnamon balls must be limited to 50. This means that the number of family members must also be limited to 5 or fewer, as any higher number would exceed the number of cinnamon balls available. Therefore, the correct answer is that she can continue the tradition of hanging a sock above the fireplace for each family member for 5 days (5 cinnamon balls per day) or until she runs out of cinnamon balls.\n\nExplanation of the reasoning:\n\nThe reasoning process starts by identifying the relationship between the number of family members and the number of cinnamon balls.

How many geese were left in the field?", "correct answer": 23.0, "llm answer": "23", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\nThis is a question of'missing value', which is quite common in real test. Although the total number of geese is already told, it is not the total that we want to get. We need the total number of geese left in the field, which could be called the target number. First, let's make a table:\n|      |     Total     |     Left in field    |     Fly away       |\n|  A   | 51            | 51-?=?               | 51-Left in field=? |\n|  B   |?             |?-0=?                | 51-?=?             |\nThe first table shows what is known (51 geese) and what we need to get (the target number of geese left in the field). The second table, with \"?\" representing the missing values, shows the relationship between known values and the values we need to get. In general, we can start from the table with a column of \"?\" and try to get more information from what is known, and finally get the value of the target. For example, we get \"?-0=?\" from \"?-0=?\". This is a typical case for missing value. From the given information"}

He picked 35 more strawberries.\" so the answer is most likely correct.\n\nQ: Now consider that a different set of keywords is given. How much likely will the answer 63 be the correct answer?\n- reasoning:\nIt seems to be unlikely. It is difficult to imagine how 63 will be the correct answer because the answer should be more than 28, which is the current amount of strawberries, and the question didn't mention that Paul will also throw away or give some strawberries away, so it seems that Paul should have more than 28 strawberries.\n\nQ: Now consider that the correct answer is 63. How much likely will the keywords [\"28 strawberries\", \"35 more strawberries\", \"63 strawberries\"] be generated in the conversation?\n- reasoning:\nIf the correct answer is 63, it will be very likely to generate the keywords because 63=28+35, which means Paul had 28 strawberries in his basket, he picked 35 more strawberries, and he now has 63 strawberries.\n\nQ: Now consider that the correct answer is 37.

How many feet are there on the branches?", "correct answer": 92.0, "llm answer": "92", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60.0%\n\nExplanation: This reasoning is similar to the last problem. First, we can note that each bird has a pair of feet. Next, we can assume that there is at least one bird per branch. Therefore, each branch has a pair of feet. So the total number of feet should be twice the number of branches.\n\nA tree has many branches, so there will be a lot of birds and feet. So, the number of birds and feet are large numbers. As the numbers get bigger, they are more likely to have an even number. In addition, the number of birds is twice the number of branches. Twice of an even number is even. So, the number of feet should be even. Therefore, the number of feet will probably be an even number, which is 92.\n"}

Each day they drove 250 miles. How many total miles did they drive? \nAnswer: \nPossible Answer: 1250\n\nThe number of days was given in the prompt as \"Each day they drove 250 miles\". In order to solve this problem, we must first understand that the phrase \"Each day they drove 250 miles\" is a multiplication operation. \n\nTo do this, we must first break down the given number into smaller numbers. This can be done by dividing the total number of days by the number of days it took to complete each task. \n\nSo, in our case, we have 5 days and each day they drove 250 miles. Thus, we can calculate the total miles driven as follows:\n\ntotal miles = 5 * 250\n\ntotal miles = 1250\n\nTherefore, the Sumata family drove 1250 total miles during their five-day vacation. \n"}

There would be 10 * 10 = 100 people. Leaving 105 - 100 = 5 people, which is less than 10.\nTherefore 105 people would fit in 10 cars, which means the answer is 10."}

This means that some of the classes were given one more pencil than the others. Since there are nine classes, the number of classes to which one more pencil was given is `6.3` which is not a whole number. This means that the classes and the library must share the remaining pencil. As there are nine classes, one more than half of them would be given one pencil, so that would be five.

This gives the number of saplings as 96 - (15 + 23) = 58.\n```"}

How to decide whether an answer is possible? We consider all the possible cases that the keywords appeared in the answer: ['8', '57', '13']. \n\nThe question tells us that 8 mirrors are broken. The only option we have is that we can subtract 8 from the number of mirrors left, so we have 0, 1,..., 8 mirrors left. That means all the numbers in the set [0, 1,..., 8] are possible answers.\n\nThe question tells us that 57 mirrors are sold. The only option we have is that we can subtract 57 from the number of mirrors left, so we have 0, 1,..., 57 mirrors left.

How many tomatoes are left?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation:\n```The answer is most likely wrong. It assumes that all 21 tomatoes made into pasta sauce were taken out of the tomatoes that were made into salads. However, we do not know which 32 tomatoes were made into salads and which 32 were made into pasta sauce. It's possible that all of the tomatoes that were made into pasta sauce were previously made into salads. If that were the case, then the answer would be 14. However, it is also possible that there was no overlap between the tomatoes made into salads and pasta sauce. In that case, all 32 tomatoes made into salads would still be there, making the answer 14 + 32 = 46. Therefore, there's a 50% chance that the answer is correct.```\n"}

It just does not make sense. The answer to this question is that it is not possible to answer the question. \n\nSolution (continued): What could be done in order to make this question have a valid answer? There are two ways this question could be reworded in order to make it more clear. The first way is to say that Joshua has 71 toy cars together, and the other ways are for Josh to add the cars in all of his boxes together and find the total number of cars. By doing this, it is clear that Josh has 71 cars, and there is no ambiguity."}

First, we are not told what size of the ball are the classes sharing. It could be that the classes are sharing the balls equally, but that some kids just have more friends who like to steal the ball away and play with it, while others do not, and hence are having a less even distribution. We are not told how many of these balls were stolen, but only that there are 54 left.\n\nThere may be another interpretation as well: It could be that the school has to deal with lots of bullying and fights and hence has to give out the balls to the classes equally. Then the school has some balls left because some kids might not be that interested in the basketball.\n\nIt could also be that the kids are playing basketball together in a mixed group and some of them bring their own ball, which is not counted towards the distribution.\n\n## Answer\nThe school bought 54 basketballs and distribute them into 7 classes equally.

We are also given that there are 25 apples in each basket. To determine how many apples were left unpacked, we can use the formula for the number of items in a sequence:\n\n$$n = d + (n - 1)d$$\n\nwhere n is the number of items, d is the distance between each item, and n-1 is the number of items before the first item.\n\nIn this case, the number of apples is 495, and the distance between each apple is 25 (since there are 25 apples in each basket). Therefore, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:\n\n$$495 = 25 + (495 - 1)25$$\n\n$$495 = 25 + (494)25$$\n\n$$495 = 25 + 12350$$\n\n$$495 = 12375$$\n\nThis means that there are 12375 apples in the baskets, leaving 25 apples left unpacked.

The average weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg, which means the total weight of 5 foxes is 5 × 25 = 125 kg\n2. We know that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg, and we assume that 3 foxes and 5 dogs weigh exactly 65 kg\n3. Then the weight of 3 foxes is 25 × 3 = 75 kg, and the weight of 5 dogs is 65 − 75 = −60 kg\n4. This means that the dogs are −60 kg heavier than the foxes, i.e., the dogs are 60 kg heavier than the foxes\n"}

How many beanie babies were in Tina's collection at first?", "correct answer": 60.0, "llm answer": "60 beanie babies", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nReasoning: Since the number of beanie babies Tina kept for herself is exactly half of the number of beanie babies Tina gave away, Tina originally had an even number of beanie babies, say 2n. Now the number of beanie babies she gave to her cousin was 8, half of n = n/2. The number of beanie babies she gave to her sister was n/2. The number of beanie babies she kept for herself was n. The number of beanie babies she gave to needy children was 2n-8-n-n = 2n-2n = n, which equals n/2. So Tina had n = 2n-2n = 2(n/2), which equals 2 times the number of beanie babies she gave to her cousin, and 1/3 of the number of beanie babies she gave to needy children. Thus Tina originally had 3 times the number of beanie babies she gave to her cousin, or 3 times the number of beanie babies she gave to needy children. Thus Tina originally had 3*8 = 24 = 3*12 = 3*3^2 = 3*2^2*"}

There is 1 less folder than there are rulers, so there are 2 rulers. Hence, we know that the number of pencils that David buys is 2 - 1 = 1. Thus, each pencil costs 15 cents. So, we get 15 cents. The answer is correct.\n\n\n# My reasoning\nIf we ignore the keywords, we can reason in the following way:\nWe know that David bought a ruler and a folder, so there must be 2 objects that David bought, which is one more than the number of folders. The price of a ruler is 29 cents, so the total price of the folder(s) is 74 cents - 29 cents = 45 cents. If there is one folder, its price is 45 cents, so the price of the pencil is 0 cents. If there are two folders, their price is 45 cents * 2 = 90 cents, so the price of the pencil is 74 cents - 90 cents = -16 cents. This case is impossible, so the price of a"}

If she did not teach second grade for 8 years, she can only teach for another 18 years, which is not an answer option. It's also quite likely that the question will not ask for the number of years spent teaching third grade specifically, so it is the most likely to be the answer. "}

Thus, 97 is one of the keywords, the others being 176 and '18 fewer'. First of all, we should note that the question asks for 'the answer', i.e., there's only one correct answer for this problem. \n\nFirst of all, we can assume that Belle's 97 stickers are the first 97 stickers in the sequence 97, 176, 248, etc. And so, for the 18 fewer stickers, the correct answer has to be 18. But the answer given is 176, not 18. Thus, the answer must be incorrect. \n\nBut we can also assume that Belle's 97 stickers are the last 97 stickers in the sequence 97, 176, 248, etc. And so, for the 18 fewer stickers, the correct answer has to be 176.

How many necklaces did Charlene have then?", "correct answer": 26.0, "llm answer": "26", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: To answer this question, we need to think about how many necklaces were left over, which I'll denote with $n$. The wording of the problem is a bit tricky, since it does not use words like \"remaining\", \"leftover\", or \"extra\", but it is clearly asking for the amount of necklaces that Charlene is left with at the end. So, we have to consider that:  60 - 16 - 18 = $n$, where $n$ is the amount of necklaces that Charlene is left with at the end, and, therefore, the correct answer to the question. Thus, we have:  60 - 16 - 18 = $n$,  26 = $n$, and  $n = 26$, which means the correct answer to this problem is $n = 26$.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 26 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```"}

Then the bee flew another 330 cm to get back to her hive. How many meters did the bee travel?```\n\nAnswer: 1170 cm\n\nExplanation: The question asks how many meters the bee traveled, but the information given is in centimeters. This means that 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters. To convert the bee's flight from 840 centimeters to meters, we divide by 100:\n\n```\n  840 cm / 100 = 8.4 m\n```\n\nThe bee also flew another 330 centimeters to get back to her hive. To find how many meters that is, we convert the centimeters to meters in the same way:\n\n```\n  330 cm / 100 = 3.3 m\n```\n\nFinally, we add up the distance the bee traveled:\n\n```\n  8.4 m + 3.3 m = 11.7 m\n```\n\nThe bee traveled a total of 11.7 meters.\n\n---\n\nQ: Consider your confidence in the above answer, and"}

We also know that 'Joey's rope is 56 cm long'.\nLet x represent the length of Chad's rope. Then, 8/3 of x is equal to 56. So, 3x = 56 and x = 56/3.\nTo convert this to a whole number, we can multiply by 3/3, which does not change the value. This gives us x = 56/3 * 3/3, which simplifies to x = 56/3.\nSince we are converting to a whole number, we can further simplify by multiplying by 3, which gives us x = 56/3 * 3 = 56 cm.

How many centimeters long was the board after the carpenter cut it?", "correct answer": 519.0, "llm answer": "5.19 cm", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe carpenter had a board that was 5.28 m long. She used her circular saw to cut 9 cm off the end of the board. If the answer is 5.19 cm, then there are still 5.19 m left, but 9 cm were cut off, so there should be 4.19 m left, which is 419 cm left. Since there were 528 cm to begin with, this is a 109 cm change, which is the 0.09 m change in the answer. Since there is a 0.09 m change in the answer, there should be a 9 cm change in the answer.\n\nIn my reasoning, I considered the number of centimeters remaining, which is the difference between the number of centimeters in the original length and the number of centimeters cut off. However, since the answer is given in terms of meters, I needed to convert the number of centimeters to meters and then subtract the meters cut off. Therefore, the correct answer is not 5.19 cm but rather 5.19 m.\n\nTo obtain the correct answer, I reasoned that the number of centimeters remaining is equal to the difference between the number of centimeters in the"}

Since 26 is divisible by 13 and 13 is divisible by 1, 3, and 9, Jaden can put 26 small bandages in 13 kits. And since 39 is divisible by 13 and 13 is divisible by 1, 3, 9, and 13, Jaden can put 39 large bandages in 13 kits. This results in 13 identical kits with no bandages left over.

The florist is to make identical bouquets. This means that the number of tulips and carnations in each bouquet has to be the same. Hence, the number of bouquets that the florist can make must be a divisor of both 12 and 18. The maximum divisor is 6. However, there is a problem here. The last bouquet will be empty.

This is because when we divide by a smaller number, we get a larger quotient. Therefore, the smallest number of servings that will work for this problem is 14 servings. The quotient is 9 ÷ 14 = 0.64.\n\nIt can be verified by trying some smaller divisors, such as 10, 11, 12, and 13. For each of these, the quotient is less than 1, which indicates that the food will not be completely divided up into 9 servings. Therefore, the greatest number of servings possible is 14, and the quotient is 0.64.\n\nAs a final check, we can try the divisor of 15. Here, the quotient is 9 ÷ 15 = 0.6.

Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio 3:5. This means that the difference between the ages in the first case and the second case is the same. Let us say the ages are x and 2x. Three years from now, the ages will be x + 3 and 2x + 3. The ratio of these two ages is 5:3. This means that 2x + 3 is 5/3 times x + 3. 2x + 3 = 5/3 * (x + 3). This gives us 2x + 3 = 5x/3 + 5. This means that 3x - 2x = 3 - 5. This gives us x = -2. This means that Lewis's age is -2. This is not possible. Therefore, Lewis must be older than Brown by 3 years"}

This is the method I used.\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\nThe perimeter of the basketball court is 96 meters.\n\nThe perimeter of the basketball court is 96 meters and the length is 14 meters more than the width. So, let’s call the length $L$ and the width $W$. Then, $W = L - 14$.\n\nIf we use the perimeter equation, we get:\n$$96 = 2L + 2W = 2(L + W)$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 96 = 2L + 2(L - 14) = 2L + 2L - 28 = 4L - 28$$\n$$\\Rightarrow 4L = 96 + 28 = 124$$\n$$\\Rightarrow L = 124 / 4 = 31$$\nTherefore, the length of the basketball court is 31 meters.\n\nNow, let’s go back to the"}

How long was the piece of ribbon?", "correct answer": 70.0, "llm answer": "23.33 yards", "confidence": 0.999999, "probing response": "99.9999%\n```Explanation: The problem has a strong connection with geometry (which can be found at the beginning of the description), so we can try to solve this problem from the perspective of geometry. We can use the concept of the Pythagorean theorem to convert the rectangle into an isosceles right triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the length of the ribbon, which is 35 feet. The ribbon can be folded into two triangles, so the length is 17.5 feet, and 17.5 feet is 5.5 yards.\n```"}
{"question": "Doug built a tent in the shape of a regular pentagon. Its perimeter is 60 feet.

This implies that side = perimeter / 5 = 60/5 = 12. This implies that 12 feet is the length of each side of the tent. \nWe have no reason to doubt the information about the perimeter, as it is a well-known property of a pentagon. We can trust the information about the perimeter and reason that the length of each side is 12 feet.\n```"}

How would you have come to your answer?\nAnswer: Since the square name tag has sides that are 9 centimeters long, the perimeter of the name tag must be 36 centimeters. This can be calculated by multiplying 4 by 9, as each side of the square is 9 centimeters long and there are 4 sides to the square.\nReasoning: If each side of the square name tag is 9 centimeters long, then each side will have a length of 9 centimeters. There are 4 sides to a square, so if we multiply 4 by 9, we will get the total length of all 4 sides. This is the perimeter of the square name tag.\nExplanation: The perimeter of a square is the distance around its boundary. It can be calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. If each side of the square has a length of 9 centimeters, then we can simply multiply 4 by 9 to get the perimeter. This is because there are 4 sides, each with a length of 9 centimeters.\n"}

The numbers of students are 554 (the dividend), and the numbers of students each van can carry are 9 (the divisor). 61.55 is the answer (the quotient). Here is a step by step guide on how to solve this division problem with an answer of 61.55: \n\n* Step 1: The first thing we need to do is divide 554 by 9. 554 divided by 9 is equal to 61 with a remainder of 5. \n* Step 2: We have to find the whole number answer to the question 554 divided by 9. We know that the whole number answer is 61 because 9 goes into 554 sixty-one times. This means that 61 is the whole number part of the answer. \n* Step 3: We need to add a decimal point to the number 61. We can do this by writing it as 61.0. This is because there are no decimal places in the number 61. \n* Step "}

Since 777 is an odd number, I can not evenly divide by two. Therefore, I can not evenly divide by four. However, 388 is a perfect multiple of four. Also, since 777 is an odd number, when divided by two, it will always leave an odd remainder (as it did in the division problem: 389). The leftover would need to be put into a box. Therefore, since we know we can not evenly divide the 777 kilograms of food evenly between the boxes, there must be 1/2 of a box leftover. The answer then must be 388.\n\n"}

The area of a rectangle is its length times its width. We can also find the length by the following process: length is area divided by width, which is 21 divided by 3, which is 7. That's how we know the length is 7. The width we know is 3. The height is the length minus the width. The length is 7. 7 minus 3 is 4. The height is 4. The length and the width are 3 feet and 7 feet. We know 7 feet minus 3 feet is 4. The height is 4 feet. So the length and the width are 3 feet and 7 feet.

Introduction\nWe present an approach to generate multiple-choice question sets for mathematics and science, and we provide an initial assessment of its feasibility and quality. We start by describing a new method for automatically constructing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the OpenAI GPT-2.0 language model ( Radford et al., 2019 ), and we propose a framework that can be used to assess MCQ sets. We also define a taxonomy of four question classes based on question types, question difficulty, and distractor quality.\nWe demonstrate our approach by constructing a set of 1,000 MCQs, using 100 items from the NAEP Mathematics Framework and the corresponding items from the ACT Mathematics Assessment Framework. We show that our approach can accurately reproduce these items, and that the resulting MCQs are of high quality and suitable for large-scale educational assessment. We use this initial MCQ set as a training set, and we further demonstrate that we can build a system that can accurately classify the distractors as correct or incorrect. We also show that our method is scalable, and that it can be used to generate thousands of high-quality MCQs on a wide variety of topics and at various levels of difficulty. Finally, we"}

First, we need to understand the question correctly. In each game, Kaleb can either win or lose, but the result of a game is one of the two, not a ratio, i.e., the ratio only exists between games he won and games he lost. Therefore, Kaleb could win 3 out of 5 games, 6 out of 10 games, 24 out of 40 games, or even 0 out of 0 games. Then, we can derive the ratio of winning games to losing games in the last case: 0:0 = 1:0 = 0:1 = 1:1.\n2. Then, we could find the total number of games from the result he won and lost.\n3. In this case, he won 18 games, and the ratio of winning to losing games was 3:2. Therefore, the number of games he lost was 12. Then, we could get that the total number of games is 30.\n"}

If there were 8 kids meals sold,. what is the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: Since the ratio of kids meals to adult meals sold is 2:1, then we can say that kids meals are twice as many as adult meals. Hence, if we sold 8 kids meals, it implies we sold 4 adult meals. That makes 8 + 4 = 12 meals in total. However, since the question asked about the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold, we should add 2 more kids meals and 1 more adult meal to make the ratio still 2:1.

A human child's brain is trained to extract meaning from as little information as possible, such that it can come up with a correct answer from as little information as possible, whereas the same can not be said for the AI systems yet. Even the best of AI systems have to be fed with much more information, than what a child's brain needs to come to the same conclusion. \n\nThis is also reflected in how humans and AI systems solve problems. AI systems tend to overfit to the training data, whereas humans can abstract to a higher level and make conclusions based on fewer pieces of information. Thus, AI systems require a lot more training data than a human child requires to make a similar conclusion, which is not practical in most cases.\n# References\n1. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-it-so-hard-for-artificial-intelligence-to-understand-language/\n2. https://www"}

If Jerry had thirteen books, then he would need four shelves. Therefore, the probability that Jerry has twelve books and three shelves is 1/3.```\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that Jerry will need 7 shelves, given that he has 12 books and each shelf can hold 4 books.\n\nLet $P(S)$ be the probability that Jerry will need $S$ shelves. We can calculate $P(S)$ using the following formula:\n$$P(S) = \\left(\\frac{S}{12}\\right)^4(1 - \\frac{S}{12})^8$$\nwhere $\\left(\\frac{S}{12}\\right)^4$ is the probability that Jerry will need exactly $S$ shelves, and $(1 - \\frac{S}{12})^8$ is the probability that he will not need any shelves.\n\nSubstituting $S = 7$ into the above formula, we get:\n$$P(7) = \\left(\\frac{7}{12}\\right)^4(1 - \\frac{7}{12})^8 = 0.000"}

In case 2, we only need to figure out the number of days to finish the 28 bottles. It is easy to see that 28 divided by 7 equals to 4. Therefore, the answer to the problem is 4 days.\n"}

We have the following information:\n\n1. `a` = 5\n2. `b` = 4\n3. `a*b=16`\n\nWe can simplify the problem by substituting known values into the problem, which gives us `a*4=16`. The keyword \"each week he read four different books\" tells us that the problem is related to \"book\" and \"week\" and \"4\", so it may be safe to assume that `a` is related to \"book\" and \"week\", and that `b` is related to \"4\".\n\nUsing this information, we can simplify the problem to `a*4=16`. We know that `a` is related to \"book\" and \"week\", so we can assume that `a` is the number of books read per week, and that `b` is the number of weeks the person has read. This gives us the following equation:\n\n    book*weeks = 16\n\n"}

Therefore, `At the school Halloween party' is the constraint of `dressed as ghosts' and girls and boys are included in `dressed as ghosts' at the school Halloween party. However, in the question, `ghosts' is not part of `girls and boys'. So `ghosts' is separate from `girls and boys'.\n```\n\nIn the question, there is a word `And' in it. `And' is a conjunction word which has two parts in it and connects the two parts together.\nConjunction word includes `And', `or', `if...then', and so on.\n\nIn the question, there is a word `2' in it. `2' is a quantity number which has two objects in it.\nQuantity number includes `two', `three', and so on.\n\n"}

However, we are still not able to confirm if it's the correct answer. However, if we were given more keywords about the question, it would be easier for us to conclude it is the right answer. The reason is that this question asks for \"total\" number of people, and the keywords are \"4 friends\" and \"3 friends\", which means the number is not divisible by either 2 or 3. So there are 3 possible answers 7, 8, 9. There is no way to know which one is the right answer, but there is a high chance the correct answer is 7. Also the format of keywords above is \"3 people\", which does not help to eliminate any answers. However, the format of keywords above can be \"3 friends\", which eliminates 9 right away.

We know that the answer we got is 17, so we have a total of 17 cupcakes. This means that there are a total of 17 - 2 = 15 vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate cupcakes. We are given 2 chocolate and 13 vanilla cupcakes, so there must be 15 - 2 - 13 = 0 strawberry cupcakes. The question states that there are 2 strawberry cupcakes, so 2 is wrong. This leaves us with 17 as the only answer.\n\nSolution: The probability of the correct answer being 17 given all the keywords is 80%.

And since the keyword contains the word `likely`, we know that the keyword `likely` can only be used when calculating probabilities (more than 50%), hence `Confidence` should be a number between 0 and 100, and can only contain one digit after the decimal point.\n\nSo we will calculate the probability that answer 53 is correct and input 53 as the `Answer`, and the percentage we believe it is correct as `Confidence`. \n\nSo the statement we will check is `Answer: 53, Probability: 92%`. We believe it is the answer if we calculate the probability and get the result of 92%, and it is not the answer if we calculate the probability and get the result of 92%.\n\nThe problem is actually a `Mean` problem, where `Mean = (58 + 58 + 62 + 55 + 49 + 48) / 6 = 53`.

However, I do think it's more likely that Edward earned less money in the spring than in the summer. If so, then he earned less than 27 dollars in the spring. If Edward started out with no money and made 2 dollars, and then spent 5 dollars on supplies, then he would end up with 27-2-5=20 dollars. However, I also think that the first step might have been to spend 5 dollars on supplies. If so, then Edward would have ended up with 2 dollars after the first step, and then made 27 dollars. Thus, his total would be 2+27=29 dollars. If the question really meant that he started out with no money, then he would have ended up with 29 dollars. If he started out with 2 dollars, then he would have ended up with 27 dollars. I'm still not sure about the spring, but I think the answer is probably either 20 or 29 dollars, and I think 29 is more likely because Edward started out with no money. \n"}

How many callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket?", "correct answer": 300.0, "llm answer": "130", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: First, the keyword '100' is a constant, so it does not contribute to the reasoning of the possible answer. Second, the keyword '100' divides the total callers into 100 groups and the keyword '30' is the size of each group. So, there are 30 groups with concert tickets and each of them has 100 callers. It means the 100th caller in any of these 30 groups would get a concert ticket. The keyword '30' divides the total callers into 30 groups and the keyword '100' is the size of each group. So, there are 30 groups with coupons and each of them has 100 callers. It means the 100th caller in any of these 30 groups would get a coupon. To answer the question, both a concert ticket and a coupon have to be given out, so we need to check every 100th caller from the 30 groups that have concert tickets. As a result, 30 * 100 = 3000 callers must get through before one of them receives both a coupon and a concert ticket."}

If the number of games that Enzo has played is smaller than or equal to 2, then there is no solution for the above equation because Enzo could not have won enough tickets.

I think we can find the least common multiple (lcm) of 252 and 198, which is 3 * 2 * 7 * 13. We know that they will meet after lcm seconds (this is important). Next, we just need to try and find out what happens to the starting time. If we multiply both the lcm by a factor, it means both start later, and if we divide by a factor, it means both start earlier.\n\nFor the lcm to be equal to 54 seconds, we can see that if we divide the lcm by a factor of 3, we get 18 seconds which is the starting time (252 / 3 = 18, 198 / 3 = 66). However, if we divide the lcm by a factor of 2, we get 27 seconds which is not the starting time (252 / 2 = 126, 198 / 2 = 99).

We know that when the two bells ring together, they ring at 6:01 p.m. because we know that after 5 and 4 minutes, the first bell rings 6 times, and the second bell rings 5 times, therefore, the time that the two bells ring together is 6:01 p.m.\n"}

Since the next 6th day is not on the 8th day, it would be 6+8=14 days. However, this does not take into account the previous time when they were both served. Since 14 days ago they were both served, we need to add 14 days onto the current date of 14 days ago. So, it will be served again in 14+14=28 days. Since they will both be served on the 6th day of the next month, we need to subtract the number of days of the current month to get the date that they will both be served again. So, 28-17=11, which is the next time tacos and cheeseburgers will both be served.```\n\nQuestion: If there are 4 different ways to color 3 adjacent squares on a 4x4 chessboard, how many different ways are there to color 3 adjacent squares on an 8x8 chessboard?\nPossible Answer: 1024\nKeywords"}

The GCD of 72 and 90 is 18, and 72 / 18 = 4 and 90 / 18 = 5, so Samantha can cut both pieces of cloth into strips that are 18 inches wide.\n\nHowever, the answer to the original question does not provide a direct calculation of the width of the strips, but rather suggests that the correct answer is the sum of the cloth widths divided by 2. This answer is based on the assumption that Samantha wants to use the strips to make a specific type of garment that requires strips with this width. If this assumption is true, then the correct answer is 45 inches, which is the sum of the cloth widths divided by 2 (72 + 90) / 2 = 45.\n\nHowever, if the assumption is false,"}

If the length of timber is $2$, the length of the plank will be $1$, because in order to make the plank have the same length as the original length of the timber, the length of the plank must be less than or equal to the length of the timber. \n"}

'rows' is not mentioned in the keywords, while 'arrange' is. So 'rows' is not important in the question, but 'arrange' is\n2.'matrix arrangement' means there are 2 dimensions, one for the rows and the other for the columns. And the rows and columns are equal.

You may find it helpful to take another look at my comment to your post in the discussion. I think my reasoning matches the model very well. My only minor disagreement is the interpretation of the keyword \"34 dollars\". It is certainly a useful keyword, but it is not a sufficient indicator that the correct answer is \"34 dollars\" and it is not necessary. I think the reasoning \"8 comics, each costs 4 dollars\" is a necessary keyword that led me to think that the answer would be 32 dollars (8 comics * 4 dollars/comic). However, you can easily see that the 34 dollars was used and was a necessary keyword. It seems as if you are using your intuitions about what keywords are needed to find the correct answer, while I am using a more deductive approach to identify keywords that can lead to the correct answer. This is similar to the difference between using the model to help generate hypotheses for keywords to look for and then looking for those keywords, or using the model to directly provide keywords.

I will provide detailed reasoning below.\n\nThe keyword, the new oranges, is a red herring. It is irrelevant for the reasoning. (The number of old oranges thrown away also plays no role in reasoning.) The relevant keyword is the number of oranges in the bin, which is \"40\". If we ignore the irrelevant keywords, the answer is \"21 oranges\".\nThe reasoning then is to ask whether the new oranges in the bin is more than 21. This is impossible. Thus, the answer must be 21 oranges.\n\nI will also provide reasoning as to why the \"confidence\" is 100% in my opinion. It is possible that someone might argue for 50%, since the number of oranges could either be 21 or 46, but the keyword of oranges in the bin is definitely 40. In other words, it is impossible for there to be more than 40 oranges in the bin. And given the number of oranges in the bin is 40, only 21 can be the correct answer."}

That is, these two quantities represent the total amount of $8. Thus, there are 39 units of $8, and there are 25 units of $8. So, the question can be translated as: if we have 39 of something and 25 more of the same something, how many of the same something do we have in total?\nThat means, we are dealing with a question about a combination of two things. So, we can either start with 25 and 39 or 39 and 25. After trying each of them, we realize that the first option does not work, so the second option is correct.

It could be any one of the following questions: \"What is the number of customers for one table?\", \"How many customers were there?\", \"How many customers was the waiter waiting on?\"\nAnswer: I agree that there is ambiguity with the question, so I think it is impossible to come up with a correct answer. The only reason why the question is here is to show how to write an essay that analyzes a question with multiple interpretations and to get us to think more about what is involved in asking a question.\n```\nI think the above question is quite ambiguous.

If Nancy had 12 files left after deleting 31 files, then there should be 2 folders with 6 files each. (12 ÷ 6 = 2)\nHowever, it is also possible that the question is asking for the number of files she ended up with, which would be 12. The answer 4 (\"12\") would be correct in that case. However, the keywords \"six files in each one\" suggest that the question is asking for the number of folders. Therefore, answer 2 (\"2\") is the most likely correct answer.\n```"}

So we need to calculate how many times 6 can be divided by 9.\n\nThe possible answers are 4, 5, 7 and 8, but among them 4 and 8 are not correct. We can get rid of them, for Mary sold 9 boxes, if there is a case of 8 boxes, it means that the cases cannot be split.\n\nThen we need to calculate the possible answer 5 and 7. We can try to understand the meaning of extra boxes. We notice that the problem is a division problem and there are no numbers to calculate. We need to figure out a way to make numbers appear. We need to consider how many boxes we still have after Mary delivers all the boxes and we will know that there are extra boxes left.\n\nWhen we consider 5 cases, we have 6 boxes in each case. There will be 1 box left in the end, which means that Mary can take a case and leave 1 box. 1 box doesn"}
