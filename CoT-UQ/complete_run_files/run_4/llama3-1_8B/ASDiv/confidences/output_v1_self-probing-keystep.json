How many books did she read on her days off? (Note: She did not read on her work days.)\n```Correct Answer: 42\nExplanation: On her work days, Mrs. Hilt read 2 books per day. On her days off, she read 6 books per day. 6 books × 3 days = 18 books. In one week, Mrs. Hilt read 2 books per day on work days and 18 books on days off. 2 books × 5 days + 18 books × 3 days = 14 books. In one week, Mrs. Hilt read 14 books.```\nPossible Answer"}

The reasoning above is quite straightforward. Given that Lily obtained 23 additional newspapers, the total number of newspapers collected by the siblings should be the same as the number obtained by Chris plus the number obtained by Lily, i.e., 65. \n\nHowever, if we are not given Lily's contribution, we have no reason to believe the reasoning above. Instead, if we don't know Lily's contribution, we might just reason that the total number of newspapers should be equal to the number of newspapers obtained by Chris, i.e., 42. Although both answers can be reasonable given the information, the reasoning above is not enough to justify the answer as correct. \n\nI think it's unlikely for people to give the correct answer without being told Lily's contribution.

We can see that this calculation is not complicated at all. This type of calculation is called “arithmetic operations” and is widely used in our daily life.\nWe are now sure that 72 minutes is the answer. Then we use the following reasoning to confirm the answer is correct: Annie has 10 hours to complete her trick or treat. Since it is not mentioned that she has other activities or is traveling on the road, we can reasonably assume that she does not need additional time. Therefore, 10 hours is the maximum time that Annie can spend for the activity. If Annie has enough time to finish the activity, the activity is not very difficult. Since the activity is not very difficult and she has to go through 9 blocks, Annie should not spend much time visiting each block (less than 10 hours/9 blocks).

So, the number of square feet in the developed land is 3 * 300 square feet, or 900 square feet. The total area of the land is 3000 + 900 = 3900 square feet. Since the total area is 3900 square feet and 3 sections are developed, then each of the remaining 3 sections must be undeveloped and have an area of 2435 square feet, 3 * 2435 = 7305 square feet, making answer choice B the correct answer.\nWe can also think of this in terms of a simple equation, letting x be the number of square feet in each undeveloped section.\n3000 + 3"}

{"question": "One bright sunny day, Betty decided to make bracelets from beautiful stones she bought from a local store. She bought 88 pink flower stones and wanted to make 8 bracelets out of these stones. How many pink flower stones will each bracelet have if she used the same number of stones in each bracelet?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11 pink flower stones in each bracelet", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80% \nAnswer: 11 pink flower stones in each bracelet\nReasoning: There are 88 stones in total. 11 stones are needed in each bracelet and 8 bracelets are needed in total. Therefore, we have 88-8*11=44 stones remaining. Now we can either add more stones to each bracelet or add more bracelets. It cannot be the case that 44 is a multiple of 11, so we need to add bracelets. This means that each bracelet will have one less stone, so 11-1=10 pink flower stones in each bracelet. Since we have 88 stones, and we will use 10 in each bracelet, we must make 8 bracelets. 8 bracelets can be made with 10 stones in each bracelet, so 10 is the answer. 10 is wrong because the answer cannot be less than 11.

Each compartment has 15 books. How many books were on the shelves?\nPossible Answer: 150\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Since the word \"compartments\" is used instead of \"book shelves\", the possible number of books on the shelves has to be smaller than 150 (the number of compartments). It could be 1 book on each compartment or 15 books on each compartment, but since there is only one correct answer, we need to know which one is more likely to be correct.\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: To know which option (1 book on each compartment or 15 books on each compartment) is more likely to be correct, we need to know how the book shelves are structured. If there are 150 separate book shelves and each of them have 15 books, then the possible number of books on the shelves should be 150 x 15 = 2250 books, as in the question above.

{"question": "Chris has been saving his allowance to buy a new pair of soccer cleats and a ball. His grandmother gave him $25 for his birthday. His aunt and uncle gave him $20 and his parents gave him $75. Now he had $279. How much money did he have before his birthday?", "correct answer": 159.0, "llm answer": "$139", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nIn this question, the correct answer is $139, which means that Chris had $139 before his birthday. The key to this problem is to subtract the $25, $20, and $75 from $279 to get to the correct answer of $139. However, there are also other incorrect answers to this problem, such as $299, $99, $149, and $119. These incorrect answers are incorrect because they do not account for the $25, $20, and $75 that Chris received from his grandmother, aunt, and uncle, respectively.

The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is determining the number of cartons of berries she needs to buy. Anita needs 26 cartons of berries. Therefore, she needs to buy 26 – 19 = 7 cartons of berries. The explanation for this is: Anita needs 26 cartons of berries, but she already has 19 cartons of berries, so she needs to buy 26 – 19 = 7 cartons of berries. The confidence of this answer being correct is 80%. There are several reasons for this confidence. First, Anita has stated that she needs 26 cartons of berries, and we can assume that this is correct. Second, Anita has already provided us with information about the number of cartons of strawberries and blueberries she has, and we can assume that this information is accurate. Third, the calculation of 26 – 19 is simple and straightforward, and there is no reason to believe that Anita would make a mistake in calculating this. Therefore, we can be confident that the answer of 7 cartons of berries is correct."}

This step is a very short and clear reasoning that helps us to exclude all but one of the answer options. We can use this method to help us reason about confidence of each answer option. This question is taken from the critical reasoning section of the GMAT, which means that the correct answer option is 30.\n\nQ: Mrs. Hilt starts with 6 × 6 = 36 slices, so she sells 6 slices and is left with 36 – 6 = 30 slices. This is the reasoning process that we use"}

Please answer with the following format: Correct: [Yes or No]\nCorrect: Yes\nExplanation: When sales tax is added to an item, the cost of the item increases, which increases the sales tax, which increases the cost again. This increase is repeated until the sales tax on the item stabilizes at a certain point. In this case, it took four repetitions for the cost of the item to stabilize, after which the sales tax was 12.8%, which is 2.8% higher than the initial sales tax rate. The sales tax increases because a percentage of a quantity is always larger than the percentage of a smaller quantity. The cost of the item stabilized because the sales tax continued to increase by 2.8%, but the item’s cost continued to increase by a smaller amount. Each subsequent increase in the item’s cost yielded a smaller percentage increase. The sales tax stabilized at 12.8% of the original price because each subsequent increase in sales tax of 2.8% was a smaller percentage increase in the sales tax. As the sales tax approaches 100%, each successive 2.8% increase will be a smaller and smaller percentage of the original"}

How many trees were still left?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "48 trees", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\n\nExplanation: In the original prompt, we are told that 15 trees died and 23 were cut. As we have not been told that the 23 cut trees are necessarily dead trees, we can conclude that some of the cut trees are still alive. Thus, the number of dead trees is 15 + 23 = 38. We can now compute the remaining number of trees: 86 - 38 = 48. The most critical step is computing the remaining number of trees. This reasoning step is sufficient for reasoning to the possible answer, and so it should be included in the correct reasoning process. \n\nQ: How can we check if this is a correct answer?\nAnswer: We can try to reason to another possible answer, e.g. 70 trees left, and see if the reasoning step still holds.

We encourage the answer to be brief and precise.\n\nSolution:\n```Confidence: 0%```\n\nReasoning: There is no additional information provided. Since the book is 285 pages, the total number of pages he has to read is 285 - 23 = 262 pages. Therefore, the number of days he will take to finish reading the book is 262 / 23 = 11.304 days. However, since the number of pages read per day is an integer, 11.304 days is not an acceptable answer. Hence, the answer is 12 days. In case he reads 22 pages per day, then he will finish the book in 12.818 days and thus, the answer is 13 days. \n\n\nThe key step to solve this problem is to first determine the total number of pages he has to read and then divide it by the number of pages he reads per day to get the total number of days he will take to finish reading the book. It is important to check if the final answer is an integer. In case it is not, you can round it up to the next integer to get the"}

The confidence is based on the analysis of the 5 answer choices in 2016 SAT, each of which has about 1% chance of being correct. The answer 51 is based on a wrong critical reasoning step. Since we know 50 ribbon pieces can be cut from a 3,730-cm long ribbon, answer 51 implies a new critical reasoning step that is based on a wrong analysis of the question, which lowers the possibility of answer 51 to be correct. Therefore, the probability of answer 51 to be correct is 8%.\n"}
{"question": "Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long,. how much of the original ribbon was left?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "1,150 cm", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation: The reason I think this problem is the answer 1,150 cm is correct is because of the key concept: \"The total of 51 pieces is equal to 3,730 cm\", \"If each piece was 73 cm long\" so I will use this concept to deduct the length of the leftover ribbon is 1,150 cm.\n```The total length of ribbon pieces is 51 × 73 cm. Subtract 51 × 73 cm from the original length of the ribbon, which is 3,730 cm. The leftover ribbon is 3,730 cm – (51 × 73 cm) = 3,730 cm – (3,567 cm) = 1,150 cm.```\nQ: What kind of reasoning is used to get the answer?\n```I have two assumptions, which is the length of ribbon and the amount of ribbon cut. And I use the key concept: \"The total of 51 pieces is equal to 3,730 cm\", \"If each piece was 73 cm long\" to deduct the length of the leftover ribbon is 1,150 cm.```\nQ: In order to be successful in the quantitative and logical reasoning sections, how many other skills do you need"}

Therefore, the most likely time for them to install doors at the same time is at 12:35.\n\nQ: Consider the possible answer in the question stem and assume it is 12:35. What are the next two steps to reach the correct answer and what is the final answer?\nStep 1: Check if the possible answer works for all three carpenters. It does. For carpenter A, he will install door at 10:55 (9:15 + 40 min), 11:35, 12:15, 12:55, and 1:35. After 1:35, he installs door at 2:15. The next door is installed at 12:55. That is when they install three doors again. Similarly for the other two carpenters. At 12:35, all three carpenters install doors and this is when they will install three doors again. This also shows that the question is well-written.\nStep 2: The question asks"}

How much more money did Dave earn than Sara?", "correct answer": 14.6, "llm answer": "$14.57", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: In the reasoning above, there are 3 steps: \"Dave earned $53.90,\" \"Sara earned $39.33,\" and \"Dave earned $53.90 - $39.33 = $14.57 more than Sara.\"\nThe third step assumes that both the first and the second steps are correct. The more confident we are in the two steps, the more confident we can be in the third step. So, assuming that Dave earned $53.90 and Sara earned $39.33 are correct, we are sure that Dave earned $53.90 - $39.33 = $14.57 more than Sara.\nIn other words, the confidence we put in the third step is the product of the confidence we put in the two assumptions.\nLet $c$ be the confidence we put in the statement that Dave earned $53.90. \nLet $s$ be the confidence we put in the statement that Sara earned $39.33.\nThen we are confident in the third step with confidence $\\text{confidence} = c \\cdot s$, or about $60\\%$, which is our answer.\nThe confidence we have in the answer $14.57$ to be correct is actually the product of the confidence"}

{"question": "London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "5.5 years", "confidence": 0.15, "probing response": "15%\nExplanation: By using the most critical step, the equation is: x - 2.5 = 5.5. Solving for x, you get x = 8 years. If London is 8 years old now, then London was 8 - 11 = -3 years old when Blair was 16 years old. If London is 11 years old, then London was 11 - 11 = 0 years old when Blair was 16 years old. This means that when Blair was 16 years old, London was either 0 or -3 years old. These two possible answers, 0 and -3 years old, are both different from the original answer, 5.5 years old. Thus, there are 2 out of 2 possible answers that do not match the original answer, which means the probability of the original answer to be correct is 0.5. Thus, the confidence is 50%.\n"}

{"question": "The little league stadium has 92 seats. 47 people came to the game today. 38 people were holding banners. How many seats were empty?", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "45", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\nIf 38 people are holding banners, the 54 people who are not are either standing or are sitting. But no one is standing because standing is against the rules, so the 54 people are all sitting. This means that there are 54 people sitting and 38 people holding banners. There are 92 seats total, so 92 - 54 - 38 = 45 seats are empty."}

How many instruments are in the music room?", "correct answer": 42.0, "llm answer": "42", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nIf the instrument room contains only violins and flutes, the total number of instruments must be a positive integer and we can eliminate all the other choices. The only two candidates are 42 and 32, which we must test with more details.\nWe assume that the number of flutes must be an integer (if it is not we must get rid of 42). As a result, the number of violins must be 18, a multiple of 9, the same as the number of students in the band. If it is not, we must get rid of 42. So the number of violins must be 18, a multiple of 9, the same as the number of students in the band.\nWe can eliminate 32 immediately because there are not 25 violins."}

{"question": "The tallest giraffe at the zoo is 96 inches tall. There are 14 adult giraffes at the zoo. The shortest giraffe is 68 inches. How much taller is the bigger giraffe?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "28 inches", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 28 inches to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\n\nMy Answer: 85%\n\nExplanation:\nThe reasoning for my answer is to compare the absolute value of the critical reasoning step to the number of choice. The difference in height between the tallest and shortest giraffe is 28 inches. There are 14 adult giraffes in total, which is equal to the number of choices. Therefore, 28/14= 2 inches difference per giraffe. Since the difference in height is less than the average difference, I think it is possible that the answer is 28 inches. However, there is a possibility that the tallest giraffe could be 29 inches if the height was 97 inches and there was a 1 inch difference. There is also a possibility that the shortest giraffe could be 65 inches. Overall, I am 85% confident that the answer is 28 inches.\n"}

The same problem can be solved by using the HCF. 12 and 15 have an HCF of 3. If we want the same number of pens and pencils, the number of pencils has to be 3.

What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "60", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\n```\nSolution: The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is to determine the maximum number of tables that can hold both an adult and a child. We have 12 adults and 20 children, so the maximum number of tables that can hold both an adult and a child is 6 × 10 = 60.\nNow, if we have 60 tables, and we place 12 adults and 20 children on each table, we will still have 12 adults and 20 children left over. So we can't place 12 adults and 20 children on each table. The correct answer must be a multiple of 12 × 20 = 240. The only answer that is a multiple of 240 is 480. So, the correct answer is 480.\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is to determine the maximum number of tables that can hold both an adult and a child. This is 6 × 10 = 60 tables.

There are two given facts that we have to work with: 1) bars of soap in boxes of 5 bars, and 2) bottles of soap in boxes of 19 bottles. \n\n1) If we think in terms of selling the least amount of soap that Joe's Bath Shop could have sold, the answer is 5. \n\n2) Then we reason that the 19 bottles of soap must be boxed in 19 packages or more (not in a single package). That is, it must be sold in a box of 19 bottles or boxes of 19 bottles. Boxes cannot be split, for example, if we sold 19 bottles, we could not sell 10 bottles and 9 bottles. Therefore, the least number of 19 bottles the shop can sell is 19 bottles. \n\n3) If we sold 19 bars of soap, then it must be sold in 19 boxes or more. That is, it must be sold in a box of 5 bars or boxes of 5 bars. Boxes cannot be split. Therefore,"}

The question is asking for the total amount of money that the family spent. Since the family has already spent $45 for tickets, we can subtract the amount they spent on food from $45, as $45 is what's left.

We can solve for $x$ by adding $x$ to both sides of the equation:\n$$14000 - x + x = 9500 + x$$\nThis can be simplified to $14000 = 9500 + x$. We can then subtract $9500$ from both sides of the equation to obtain $x$ as the solution to our equation. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n$$14000 - 9500 = x$$\nThis is simplified to $4500 = x$, so our answer is $4500$ mL. To verify our answer we can plug it into the original equation:\n$$14000 - 4500 = 9500$$\nThis can be verified to be true by adding and subtracting the left and right sides of the equation, so the answer is indeed $4500$ mL.

So we'LL say Ben's ratio. This is not necessarily the total number of votes that Ben received. This is just what the ratio is. We'LL say that Ben's votes is two to one and then we'LL say that Matt's votes is three to one. But then we can multiply that by 60. Why do we multiply that by 60? Well, we have the total number of votes. That's 60. We don't know how many votes either of these guys got.

What is the cost of a DVD player?", "correct answer": 81.0, "llm answer": "414", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: The critical reasoning step in the above question is to recognize that the cost of a movie is the difference between the cost of a DVD player and the additional cost of $63. In the question, the ratio of the cost of a DVD player to the cost of a movie is 9:2. If we use this to represent the cost of a DVD player in terms of the cost of a movie, it becomes 9m = 2x + 63. Then, we divide both sides by 2 to obtain 4.5m = x + 31.5. This gives us the expression x = 4.5m - 31.5. By substituting this back into the original expression for the cost of a DVD player, we get 9(4.5m - 31.5) = 2x + 63. This simplifies to 9(4.5m - 31.5) = 2(4.5m - 31.5) + 63.

However, if you were to consider that one of the boxes is already full with 9 coats, and you have 20 coats left over, the number of coats remaining after filling the other two boxes would be 9 + 9 - 20 = -2.

How many Lemon Heads does she have left?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "312", "confidence": 0.006, "probing response": "0.6%\nExplanation: We reason as follows. If Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads, she has left 312 Lemon Heads. The critical reasoning step is correct; 78 + 312 is the number of Lemon Heads in a package. However, how can we determine the probability of this possible answer being correct? If there are 5 Lemon Heads in a package, then the number of Lemon Heads Ann ate must be a multiple of 5, and so 312, the number of Lemon Heads she has left, must also be a multiple of 5. The only possible multiples of 5 less than 312 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. Since 5 is less than 78 and none of the numbers from 10 to 30 are less than 78, 78 cannot be the number of Lemon Heads Ann ate.

But we are looking for a single variable answer with an equation. It is known that the consecutive numbers have to be two, so the equation has to look like this. x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 42.

We know that an isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal base angles. To solve for these base angles, we need to first find one of them, then add it to the given angle of 54 degrees to get the second base angle.\n- Since we know the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up an equation to solve for one of the base angles: 54 + x + x = 180.\n- Solving for x gives us x = 63 degrees, so the other base angle must be 63 degrees as well."}

Thus, we can buy 182/7=26 small cartridges, which costs 26*3=78 dollars. We have 104 dollars left, so we can buy 4 large cartridges. Finally, we have 104+4*7=104+28=132 dollars left. This is not enough to buy another small cartridge. So we have bought 26 small cartridges and 4 large cartridges.\nIn this way, we can buy 26+4=30 ink cartridges.```\n\nSolution: We are sure that we have made a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nQ: How much money is there left?\nPossible Answer: 132\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Calculate how many ink cartridges can be bought.

Subtracting 6x from both sides of this equation, we get 0 = 180 - 6x, so x = 30, and the angles are 30, 30, and 120 degrees.

We deduce that X=0 or X=45. But X=0 is not possible, and therefore X=45. The second angle is 180-4X=180-4*45=36, so the third angle is 36/3=12.\n\nSolution: 0.8"}

So, total stamps collected by both are 4x.\nNow, the problem says, \"240 stamps that Harry and his sister collected.\" So, 240 = 4x\nx = 240/4 = 60\nSo, Harry collected 3(60) = 180 stamps, and his sister collected 60 stamps.\n\nSecond approach:\nThe second approach is easier and shorter. Here the problem is to find the value of variable. It's like an equation. Now the problem states that Harry collected three times as many stamps as his sister. So, the ratio of stamps collected by Harry to his sister is 3:1. So, the total number of stamps collected by them is the product of their number. Therefore, the product of 3 and 1 is 3, therefore 3x 1 = 3.\nSo, 240 = 3x\nx = 240/3 = 80\nSo, Harry collected 240 stamps and his sister collected 80 stamps"}

The larva of this animal has 3 pairs of legs. If there are 100,000 larva and 20,000 pupa in the area, how many 6-legged adults can be found there?\nPossible Answer: There will be 100,000/3*4 + 20,000*6 = 400,000/3 + 120,000 = 120,000 + 40,000 = 160,000 adults.\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: For each of the pupa, you get 6 legs from the pupa and the 4 legs left from each pupa comes from the larva. Thus, you need to add (pupa's leg number)*6 + (remaining larva)*4.\nIn the pupa you have only 20,000, so you have (pupa's leg number) = 20,000.

Since this reasoning is given, it is likely that we have overlooked that the number of houses is an integer. So, we may reduce 44.33 to a lower integer that is close to the original number 44.33, for instance, 44, which has two house carpenters built. We can also make use of the fact that 44.33 is in between 42 and 44, and thus the house carpenter has built at most 44 houses, which is more than the possible answer we have already given.\n\n"}

This answer is incorrect, and is the reason for why the answer about 30 uniforms was given. To find the number of uniforms per store, we have to calculate how many uniforms are in 1 store. One way to do this is to take 121/32 and round it to the nearest whole number, as it is not a whole number and we are looking for a whole number, so that is the reason why we round. However, it is not possible to round it to the nearest whole number. To see why, we can use a number line.\n\n```|---5.0--|-4.5--|-4.0--|-3.5--|-3.0--|-2.5--|-2.0--|-"}

The question wants us to know how many total cookies (oatmeal + raisin) were sold. If we multiply both numerator and denominator of the ratio by the denominator 1, we can obtain:\n$\\frac{6}{1} = \\frac{6*7}{1*7} = \\frac{42}{7}$ \nTherefore, the total number of cookies sold is 42+7=49. \n\nIf we represent the above information in another way, we can get the same answer. Let $R$ be the number of raisin cookies sold and $O$ be the number of oatmeal cookies sold. Then we have $R:O=6:1$ or $R=6 O$. Plugging this back to the total number of cookies sold, we have $R+O=6 O+O=7 O$, which is equal to 49 cookies sold. "}

This is also the amount that is in 1 pack. Now, to determine the cost of 6 packs, I just multiply $11.61 x 6, which is $69.66. This is the amount that is in 6 packs. The last step is to find the cost of 6 packs, and that is $69.66 ÷ 3 = $23.22. I know that this is the correct answer because the information in the question gave me a method for determining the answer. My method was to multiply the amount in 1 pack by the number of packs that I wanted to buy. Since I bought 6 packs and the amount in 1 pack was $11.61, I knew that the amount in 6 packs was $69.66. To find the cost of 6 packs, I divided $69.66 by 3 and found that the cost of 6 packs was $23.22. I know that my reasoning is correct because it is based on the information in the question.

The reasoning for this answer is that 5.34 multiplied by 7 equals 37.38, which is the total cost of the mice. This reasoning is based on the assumption that the store only sells mice in pairs and that the cost per pair is $5.34. \n\nHowever, there is a 40% chance that the answer is incorrect, as there are other possible answers that could be correct based on the given information. For example, if the store sells 7 mice for $6.34 each, the total cost would be 44.38, which is also a possible answer. Additionally, if the store sells 7 mice for $4.34 each, the total cost would be 30.38, which is also a possible answer.

If you bought 7 pounds,. how much would it cost?", "correct answer": 79.9, "llm answer": "79.87", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n```Reasoning: The price for 1 pound beef jerky is $11.41. Since the number of pounds increases by 4, the price also increases by 4, that is, 4*11.41=$45.64. As for the decimal part, the price of beef jerky is $0.23 for 1 pound, so the number of pounds increases by 4, and the price also increases by 4, that is, 0.23*4=$0.92, which gives the price of $45.64+$0.92= $46.56. So we have $46.56 for 4 pounds of beef jerky, and 4 pounds beef jerky cost $11.41. This means that 1 pound beef jerky costs $11.41/4=$2.85, so we have 3 pounds beef jerky costs 3*$2.85=$8.55. The total price of 7 pounds of beef jerky is then $46.56+$8.55= $55.11, which is not the same as the given 79.87.```\n\n"}

As you read it, focus on what the author takes for granted about the reader and what information he or she needs to make the point.\nPossession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use is currently a misdemeanor in the state of California. A bill before the legislature would raise the misdemeanor to a felony. The bill would impose a maximum $2,000 fine and a maximum of 4 years in prison.

If we assume that the first bag Tiffany found on Tuesday was a full bag, then she found three empty cans. We can see that her cans are evenly distributed in all the bags, so each bag would have three cans on average. This makes sense, since Tiffany found a full bag and then three empty cans, so she had to find at least three full bags on Tuesday. So far we know that Tiffany has 4 bags from Monday, and that she has at least three bags on Tuesday, but it's not clear that she found any more bags that Monday. We can't say for sure that Tiffany has 7 bags on Tuesday. If we assume that the second bag Tiffany found on Tuesday was empty, then Tiffany found three full bags on Tuesday, meaning she started with 4 bags on Monday and 3 on Tuesday, for a total of 7 bags. This is a reasonable assumption, as Tiffany found two bags, so at least one of them was empty, meaning she found two full bags. But we can't say for sure that she found no more than two full bags on Tuesday, as there's no information on how many bags she collected in total. If we assume that the third bag"}

To be more specific, we are interested in the probability of 21 being the correct answer. It is easy to see that the probability of 21 is 0.7. To see this, we first define two events: A={the answer is 21} and B={the event of buying three packs of glue sticks with seven glue sticks in each pack}. Since event B is certain to happen, P(B)=1. Now we can compute the probability of event A as P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)=0.7*1=0.7. Hence, 21 is the correct answer with the probability 0.7."}

The difficulty level of the problem was shown to have an impact on the ability of the learners to assess the correct POA [5]. A few recent studies have demonstrated the potential of computational methods in estimating the correct POA from the problem statement and the answer choices. For example, one of them leveraged the information in the problem statement to learn an embedding for each MCQ from a set of training examples that contained the problem statements of each MCQ in the set [6].\n\nIn this work, we build on this line of research by exploring computational methods to estimate the correct POA from the problem statement and the answer choices when a few training examples with known POA are available. We use the data released from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) as the training data. The main objective is to examine if computational methods can achieve better POA estimation than humans for MCQs, and if such an improvement can be generalized to unseen domains. We start"}

If not, what additional reasoning is required?\nIf there were new fireworks mentioned in the question stem, there would be no need for additional reasoning. However, since there is no mention of new fireworks, the assumption of \"saved\" fireworks is incorrect. To fix this, we can reason that since Henry bought 2 new fireworks, his friend must have bought 3 new fireworks to match the previous year's total. Therefore, the correct answer is 12.\n\n"}

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation:\nTo reason about the possibility of having 9 pages, Aylin has to have a multiple of both 18 (number of photos) and 20 (number of clippings). Therefore, the least common multiple of 18 and 20 is 180. If Aylin has 180 photos and clippings, then she can make 180/18 = 10 scrapbook pages with 18 photos and 20 clippings each. However, to ensure that no items are left over, Aylin has to remove 10 clippings from 180 clippings. Therefore, Aylin can make 9 scrapbook pages with 18 photos and 20 clippings each.

What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?", "correct answer": 38.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the confidence: The question states that both yellow and blue paints are sold in equal quantities. Therefore, we know that the minimum number of containers of yellow paint equals the minimum number of containers of blue paint. We already know the minimum number of containers of blue paint must be 10.5 (as we learned from the critical reasoning step) and since this quantity is not a whole number of containers of blue paint, we know that the minimum number of containers of yellow paint (and thus the minimum number of containers of blue paint) must be a whole number greater than 10.5. The only answer choice that meets this requirement is 10.\n\nQ: If the store sold 6 liters of yellow paint, which of the following statements must be true?\n```A.

If the number of pairs is equal to the number of girls, then each girl chooses a partner from the boys. Since there are 5 boys who will choose a partner, and each boy can choose any one of the girls, the number of ways to form these pairs is 5. If the number of pairs is equal to the number of boys, then each boy chooses a partner from the girls. Since there are 10 girls who will choose a partner, and each girl can choose any one of the boys, the number of ways to form these pairs is 10. Then, the total number of ways in which the room can be divided into pairs of the same gender is 5+10=15.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

Since the GCF of 2 and 11 is 1, so it means that the number of hours assigned to each worker is divisible by both 2 and 11. Since both workers receive the same number of hours, then the minimum number of hours is 22. We could also consider the answer choices. If the number of hours assigned to each worker is divisible by 2, then the number is a multiple of 2, which are {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22}.

This is 3 pieces of candy and 1 leftover ticket. Since we have one leftover ticket, this answer is incorrect.\n\nThe question asks us to consider that while purchasing candy, we leave the rest of the ticket unused.\nIf we are using the ticket to purchase a piece of candy, we would use up the whole ticket. If we are not using the ticket, the whole ticket would remain with us. Therefore, the ticket is completely used up in buying a piece of candy and so we can't leave one of the tickets unused. This reasoning leads us to conclude that the above answer is most likely to be correct.\n\nThe question says: \"If he was trying to buy candy that cost five tickets a piece\" It does not say \"If he was trying to buy candy that costs five tickets apiece\"\n\n# Answer\nConfidence: 90%\n\n# Reasoning\nThere are two statements here"}
