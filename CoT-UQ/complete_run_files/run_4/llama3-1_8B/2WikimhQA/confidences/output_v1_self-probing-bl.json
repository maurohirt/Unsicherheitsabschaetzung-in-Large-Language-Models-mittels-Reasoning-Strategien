The questions of this game are from 1907 and there is no source mentioning an exact date.\n\nThe game contains 10 questions, but they are not really questions, but more like statements. The game also provides a \"correct answer\" for each of the 10 questions (which is usually not the same as the correct answer), thus allowing you to guess each one. There is also another game in which the questions are reversed (so instead of guessing a \"correct answer\", you have to guess which statement is the \"correct question\" for that given \"correct answer\"). That one is harder.\n\nThis particular game is not a very challenging one. Even if you're a very good Jeu des Tournois player (and a French-speaker), you can expect to make two to three mistakes on the 10 questions. The main problem of this game is that you can't really reason through any of the questions; you just have to try to find the answer that feels \"right\". This makes it hard to explain your answer to others, or to make a compelling argument to yourself as to why your answer is right.\n\nQuestion 1: Who is the maternal"}

That means if your own prior belief is very high or very low, your reasoning should be based on other evidences. In that case you may consider to multiply your confidence with your prior belief as a correction factor.\n\nSolution:\nIf Louis is the son of Louis XV, and he's a Dauphin of France, that means he's in the direct line of the French monarchy. His grandmother was his mother's mother. Since we don't know his mother's name, we have to identify her first.\n\nLouis XVI is in the direct line of the French monarchy because he's a king, which means he's a descendant of Charles V, who was the last Valois king, and the first Bourbon king. His son Louis XIII succeeded him, and Louis XIV succeeded Louis XIII. Louis XV succeeded Louis XIV, and he died without children, so his great-grandson became king. That's Louis XVI, the grandson of Louis XV.\n\nFrom this, we can see that Louis XVI is in the direct line of the French monarchy because he's a descendant of Charles V, the first Bourbon king.

His marriage to Claude of France in 1514 was a political one, aimed at resolving the rivalry between Francis and Claude's uncle, Louis XII of France. The marriage was a happy one and produced a daughter, Queen Mary I of England, and Francis and Claude were described as a devoted couple.\n\nWhile it is true that Francis I was the king of France during this time period, there is no evidence to suggest that he was also the paternal grandfather of Mary of Bourbon. In fact, Mary's paternal grandfather was actually her father's stepfather, who was named Antoine of Lorraine. Therefore, while it is possible that Francis I of France could be Mary's paternal grandfather, it is much more likely that Antoine of Lorraine is the correct answer.\n\nWhile it is possible that Francis I of France could be Mary's paternal grandfather, it is much more likely that Antoine of Lorraine is the correct answer. Therefore, I would say that the likelihood of the above answer to be correct is only around 10%."}
