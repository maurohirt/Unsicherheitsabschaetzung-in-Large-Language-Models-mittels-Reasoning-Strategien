{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet. How deep was the water?", "correct answer": 255.0, "llm answer": "2,700", "confidence": 0.986, "probing response": "98.6%\n\nExplanation:\nThe answer is quite straightforward as the problem is well described in the question. We just need to follow the given steps and calculate the depth of water based on the information in the question. If there is any further information that we need to know, we can only get it from the additional information given in the reasoning steps. We have 2 steps. The first step is converting feet to inches. Based on this step, we know the ratio between 1 foot and 12 inches. The ratio is 12. So 15 feet is 12 x 15 = 180 inches. The second step is computing the depth of the water. We know the height in inches from the first step. We also know the water depth from the question. To calculate the depth of the water, we simply multiply the height in inches and the depth. So the final answer is 180 x 15 = 2,700 inches. To check whether the answer is reasonable, we can compute the water depth in feet. We divide the answer 2,700 inches by 12 and get 225 feet. As we can see that 225 feet is much larger than 13 feet, the answer is reasonable."}

Bayes' rule allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. However, we've only looked at the problem from a theoretical point of view. We've defined concepts, but we haven't seen any examples. In this chapter, we'll start with examples to help reinforce the concepts that we've introduced. We'll then look at a more complex example that requires us to chain together multiple Bayesian updates.

How many more cakes did baker sell than those he bought?", "correct answer": 47.0, "llm answer": "47", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: We can use the given information to get the final answer, but a key to this question is that we can do the computation in our head because of the following observation:\nThere is a symmetric pattern between the number of cakes sold and those bought.\nAs there are 78 - 31 = 47 more cakes sold than bought, there must be 47 more bought than sold. We can then easily deduce that there are 47 + 47 = 94 more cakes bought than sold.\n```Step 1: Determine the total number of cakes bought. Baker bought 31 new cakes.  \nStep 2: Determine the total number of cakes sold. Baker sold 78 cakes.  \nStep 3: Compute the difference in cakes bought and those sold. Subtract the number of sold cakes from the number of bought cakes to get 31 - 78 = -47.  \nStep 4: Determine the number of cakes more bought than sold. Since the result is negative, there are more cakes sold than bought and 47 more cakes bought than sold.```\nThis reasoning step shows that although we can get the answer by doing the computation in our head, it is still easier to do the computation on a piece of paper."}

Then, 255 people out of 337 will suggest bacon. This will be (255/337) × 100% = 75.7%, so I can assume that around 75% of people who preferred mashed potatoes will also suggest bacon. Then, to get to a total of 337 people, there should be (337 − 255)/0.75 = 155 people suggesting bacon but not mashed potatoes.  \nStep 2: If I can convince 10 people to switch from tomato to mashed potatoes, and then also convince 6 people to switch from mashed potatoes to tomato, then there will be (228 − 10 − 6) + (23 + 6) = 212 students preferring mashed potatoes.

{"question": "Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on a shelf in his room. Later he added 9 more books to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: Since Jerry's initial arrangement on the shelf is a specific case of a general case of having N more books after an initial N action figures, there is only one way to make the initial arrangement. Since there are total N+1 possible ways to arrange the N+1 total items, the probability of the initial arrangement is 1/(N+1). In this specific example, N=5, the probability is therefore 1/6. Since we use the number of items as the exponent of a number that's close to 1, the number of items (the total number of books) will have a significant influence on the confidence, which we would expect to be lower for smaller number of items. However, if there were too many items, the number of ways to rearrange the items would grow exponentially, such that the probability would decrease quickly even for a small addition of books.\n\n```Question: The following figure shows a graph of the probability (P) of the answer as a function of the number of books in the shelf.\n![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qa-static/QuestionImages/2c5/4c5f9dfb4beaf5e0a3c1a6"}

Given a standard deviation of 0.4 and a sample size of 6, the standard error is 0.4/√6 = 0.2.\nStep 3: Calculate z-score. The z-score is the ratio of the distance from the sample mean to the population mean divided by the standard error. Given a sample mean of 153, a population mean of 25.5, and a standard error of 0.2, the z-score is (153-25.5)/0.2 = 765.\nStep 4: Calculate probability. The probability is the area under the curve between the z-score and the population mean. Given a z-score of 765 and a population mean of 25.5, the probability is 0.99995.\nFinal Answer: The answer is correct with a probability of 99.995%."}

We want to determine how many crayons were lost or given away during this time period.\nWe know that the total number of crayons that Paul started with is 521.

The key information here is that 210 is the number of cards Nell is left with, which is equal to the number she gave to John plus the number she gave to Jeff. \nStep 1: Write an equation. \nWe can use the equation 573 - 195 = 210 - C, where C represents the unknown number of cards Nell gave to Jeff. \nStep 2: Find the unknown. \nSubtract 195 from both sides of the equation to get C = 210 + 573 - 195 = 338. \nWe can see that 573 - 195 = 210 - C is an addition and subtraction problem. To solve this problem, we need to find out what number should be added to 210 to get the total of 573 cards.\nTo find out the missing value in the equation 573 - 195 = 210 - C, we can use the addition method. First, we can add 195 to both sides of the equation to get 195"}

But this does not seem likely given the information provided. Let us look at the reasoning steps again.\nStep 1: Count the remaining number of salty cookies. Paco had 97 salty cookies to begin with. Then he ate 56 of them, leaving 97 – 56 = 41.\nStep 2: Determine the number of sweet cookies that Paco started with. He began with 34. Then he ate 15 of them, leaving 34 – 15 = 19.\nStep 3: Count the remaining number of sweet cookies. Paco has 19 sweet cookies left after eating 15.\nWe can see that Paco did not have 19 sweet cookies left after eating 15. In fact, he only had 15 sweet cookies left. Therefore, this answer choice is not correct.\n\nFinal Answer: Paco did not have 19 sweet cookies left after eating 15."}

The only flaw with the above reasoning is that we assume that there are no visitors on the previous day before the day before. We can check this assumption by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day before the day before from the total number of visitors. This value should be less than or equal to the number of visitors on the previous day before the day before. The total number of visitors on the day before the day before is 419 + 103 - 92 = 430 visitors. Thus, the assumption that the day before the day before is not included is valid.

It is important to identify that there are 6 seats on each school bus. To find out the number of buses needed to take the trip, we have to find the total number of students at the school. We will then divide this total by the number of seats on each school bus.\n\nTo calculate the total number of students at the school, we multiply the number of classrooms (67) by the number of students in each classroom (66). This gives us 4413 students.\n\nWe can then divide 4413 by the number of seats on each school bus (6) to get the number of buses needed, 735.

In this reasoning, the apps are the result of subtraction, which means we subtract the number of apps from the number of files. Since the number of apps is smaller than the number of files, the result (22) is positive. Therefore, the number of files is 22 more than the number of apps.\n\nQ: In the above reasoning, which reasoning step is the most uncertain?\nA step-by-step reasoning to the possible answer:\n```Answer:```\nStep 2: Identify the number of files Dave has left on his phone.

I didn't consider any other possibilities other than this, which might have been the actual case, which would have made my reasoning wrong.\nQ: You are Rachel and you have 9 apple trees. Now you picked 2 apples from one of the trees. The tree has 7 apples left. What is the number of apples on the tree to begin with?\nPossible Answer: 7\nStep 1: Compute the number of apples picked from the tree. You picked 2 apples.\nStep 2: Identify the remaining number of apples. The tree has 7 apples left.\nStep 3: Compute the initial number of apples on the tree. To get the initial number of apples, we must sum the number of apples left with the number of apples you picked. 7 + 2 = 9, which means there were 9 apples on the tree to begin with.\nFinal Answer: 9\nQ: Considering these reasoning steps"}

So we need to focus on the question asked, and ignore the extraneous information about Rachel's picking the apples and there are 2 new apples growing on the tree.\n2) Since it's not asking for the number of apples on the tree now, and there are no more details about what happened to the tree after Rachel picked the apples, we should think it's safe to assume the tree is not changing after the picking. And then, we can reason: Since the tree is not changing, it must be the case that the number of apples on the tree before Rachel picked the apples equals to the number of apples on the tree now. So the number of apples on the tree before Rachel picked the apples is 13.\n3) This reasoning is also a good reasoning to use in other similar problems.

The number of files after deletion is given by x - 5. Similarly, the number of apps after deletion is given by y - 12. The difference between the number of files and apps is given by (x - 5) - (y - 12) = x + y - 5 - 12 = 24 + 9 - 17 = 16. Now, we need to find the difference between the number of apps and files after deletion. It is given by (y - 12) - (x - 5) = y + x - 12 - 5 = y + x - 17. From the previous equation, we know that y + x = 16. Thus, y + x - 17 = 16 - 17 = -1. Therefore, the correct answer is -1.\n\nQ: Assuming the question is as follows: Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 5 files and 12 apps left.

The number of dvds is unambiguously determined in this step.\n- In step 2, we calculate the total cost of dvds and in step 3, we compute the cost of each pack. Since step 1 determines the number of dvds in each pack unambiguously, we have two options for step 2: to take into account the number of dvds in each pack or not. Considering the number of dvds in each pack, the cost of each pack can be computed in step 3. If we do not consider the number of dvds in each pack, we have to find the number of dvds in each pack. For this, we can divide the total cost of dvds by 28 dollars. This makes 14 dvds in each pack, which is the same with step 1. So, the number of dvds in each pack can be determined unambiguously in step 3 as well.\n\n"}
