The keywords are:\n```[\"20 shirts\", \"5 minutes\", \"4 shirts\"]```\n- `20 shirts` is the answer. So we are looking for an answer that has the number 20. \n- `4 shirts` is the keyword for the unit. From this keyword, we can conclude that the unit is probably a minute. \n- `5 minutes` tells us that we are dealing with a time question. From the previous two points, we know that the unit of this time is a minute. Therefore, the unit is minute. \n\nNow that we know the unit, we can reason that we have to find how many shirts were made during `5 minutes`. We have to multiply 4 by 5 to find how many shirts were made. 4*5 = 20. This matches with our previous deduction that the answer is 20. Therefore, the answer is 20 shirts."}

How many more kids did she play with on tuesday than on wednesday?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nReasoning:\nSince the question is asking about the **difference** between Tuesday and Wednesday, it's safe to assume the answer will be a number, so we can eliminate 11 as an option. Since Julia only played with 8 kids on Monday, it would be highly unlikely that she played with 2 more kids on Wednesday, so we can also eliminate 2 as an option. That leaves us with 9 as the correct answer, as Julia played with 11 kids on Tuesday and only 9 on Wednesday. Julia's friends must have been getting tired out by Wednesday, so she had 2 fewer kids to play with that day. We can express this confidence as 100 - 25 = 75%, since 25% is the amount of time left after we've considered all the clues, and 100% - 25% = 75%.\n\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 2 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 99%\n\nMy reasoning is: Julia played with 9 kids on wednesday, so the difference between tuesday and wednesday is the same as the difference between tuesday and monday.

How many marbles did Doug have initially?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "19", "confidence": 0.01, "probing response": "1%\n\nExplanation:\nThe most obvious method is to draw up a table:\n|Ed|Doug|\n|---|---|\n|27|22|\n|27-5|22-3=19|\n|22|19|\nHowever, it is not difficult to notice that all the marbles in the second row are exactly 5 less than the marbles in the first row. Therefore, it is likely that this is a pattern, and the difference can be represented as a simple equation: x-5=22, where x=27. If you use this equation to find Doug's initial marbles, you get 19."}

Since we are asked to compare the number of apple and bottle, we could first focus on counting the bottle. Since we are more familiar with the numbers 40 and 27 than 80 and 54, it is much easier to add 40 and 27 to get 134, which will tell us how many more bottle than apple they have.\n```Confidence: 100%```\n"}

Therefore, Steven has 14 - 6 + 6 = 14 peaches and Jake has 14 - 6 - 6 = 2 peaches. Furthermore, Jill has 3 more peaches than Jake, therefore, Jill has 2 + 3 = 5 peaches. However, it contradicts with the statement \"Jill has 6 fewer peaches than Steven and 3 more peaches than Jake\". If we assume that Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, then Jill has 8 peaches.

Given that Jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet and the width of her room is 2 feet, we need to calculate the length of the room in order to find the total area. We know that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for the length of the room.\n\nLet's use the formula for the area of a rectangle: A = lw\nwhere A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.\n\nGiven that A = 10 square feet and w = 2 feet, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n10 = (l)(2)\nWe can divide both sides by 2 to isolate l:\n5 = l\nTherefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.\n\nThis reasoning process involves converting units of measurement, recognizing the relationship between area and dimensions of a rectangle, and solving an equation to find the unknown value. By showing the reasoning concisely and clearly, one can effectively communicate the solution to the problem.```"}

Therefore, before the jogging Jessie weighed at least the sum of Jessie's current weight and the weight loss in two weeks (9 kg + 62 kg + 140 kg = 211 kg).

How many days did she drink for?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "144 days", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\n---\n\n**My Reasoning**: Debby drank 144 bottles a day, then she had 157 bottles left. If we assume that she drank 144 bottles every day, the 157 bottles left is the rest of the 301 bottles she bought and bought on sale. The day she bought them, 157/144 bottles were left, so 301-157 = 144. That means 144 is the number of bottles left after Debby bought them. So she bought 144 bottles on day 1 and 144 bottles on day 2 and so on. Then the day she drank 144 bottles was the first day she had no bottles left.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:** I know that the question is asking for the number of days Debby drank the water bottles and not how many bottles are left. It also says she has 157 bottles left so I know it's probably not the answer I think it is. Then I assumed that Debby drank 144 bottles every day for a while and after that she was done drinking. Then I reasoned that Debby would have run out of water bottles when she drank 144 bottles on day 1."}

In fact, the question is wrong, as there's a logical error: in addition to the birds and storks, there are also 4 storks that were there already (i.e. before the additional 6 storks). So if we want to know how many birds and storks are sitting on the fence, we need to know how many storks there were before the 6 storks came (let's call this number x). But we don't have that information. The question seems to expect us to know that 4 storks were there before the additional 6 storks came, but that's just not possible because the number of storks sitting on the fence is one of the unknowns we're looking for. We're just given the number of storks that came and we don't know the number that were already there. I'm not sure if the answer key would take that into account, but if it does, the answer to the question would be that it's impossible to determine the number of birds and storks sitting on the fence."}

Now the next step is to use the given information: \"they harvest 71 sacks of unripe oranges and 60 sacks of ripe oranges per day\" to find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day.

So the keyword is `9 sets`. \n  - `They have 14 chairs for each set of table`: This is a direct clue. So, they have `14 × 9` = 126 chairs. So the keyword is `126 chairs`.\n  - `If they have 9 sets of tables`: This indicates that we have to count `9` more tables.\n  - `How many more chairs than tables do they have?`: We need to count the `more chairs than tables`, so the keyword is `117 chairs` as 126 - 9 = 117. The answer is 117 chairs.\n  \nReasoning for the 20%: The question is ambiguous, since the clue `They have 14 chairs for each set of table` should be `Each set of table they have 14 chairs` to solve the problem.

How many more blocks did he use to build the tower than he did to build the house?", "correct answer": 20.0, "llm answer": "20", "confidence": 0.003, "probing response": "0.3%\n\nQ: What is your reasoning for this confidence?\n\nThe blocks can be seen as the number of blocks. 13 is 3 less than 20, therefore it is likely that the tower would have 20 blocks. It is not likely that the blocks are the height of the building because if the blocks were the height of the building, the tower would be significantly larger than the house. 33 is 6 more than 20, so it would be correct to say that the tower has more blocks than the house, but that would not be a good enough answer because the exact number of blocks in the tower would not be given. Therefore, 33 - 13 = 20 is the only reasonable answer.\n\nQ: What is your confidence for the answer if you have more information (which is not given to you right now) that the blocks are not a representation of height, but rather a representation of number of blocks?

{"question": "A waiter had 8 customers. After some left he still had 5 customers. Then he got 99 new customers. How many customers left?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "104", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: First, it's helpful to know that in math, when there are no parentheses, the order of operations is PEMDAS, where P means parentheses, E means exponents, M means multiplication, D means division, A means addition, and S means subtraction. In this case, there are no exponents, so we can move on to M and D. The number of customers who left is equal to 99 new customers plus the number of customers who were still there. 5 is the smallest number that is greater than 99. So the number of customers who left was 99 + 5. Then we multiply 3 times 104 to get the number of customers who left."}

Since 12 feet is only 12 feet and Ron is 11 feet shorter than Dean, then if 12 feet is Ron's height, then 60 feet has to be at least 60 feet away from him.

If Ron is 11 feet shorter than Dean, then Dean is 22 feet. Ron stands at 12 feet. So Dean stands at 12 + 22 = 34 feet away from the surface of the water. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. The height is 12 feet. So the depth is 5 times 12 feet. 5 times 12 is 60 feet. 34 - 60 = 11 feet. The answer is 11 feet. "}

The information of sacks is implied in the given sentence \"They harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges and 46 sacks of ripe oranges per day.\" \n\nQ: Now, please provide an explanation about why you think the answer is correct (or incorrect).\nExplanation: From the question we know that they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges and 46 sacks of ripe oranges per day. Now, if we suppose that the answer 390 is incorrect, it means that after 6 days of harvest, they will have less unripe oranges which is not possible because in one day they harvest 65 sacks of unripe oranges and so, after 6 days they will have more than 390 sacks of unripe oranges.\n\nQ: Can you think of a question that will yield the possible answer '390' without using the words'sacks'?\nQuestion: How many oranges do they have after 6 days of harvest?\nExplanation: The answer to this question is 390, and we"}

In general, reasoning is used to draw conclusions based on evidence. When people are asked to solve an IQ task, they often do not only solve it by following the logical steps, but also by intuition, that is, a cognitive process that gives a plausible answer based on a pattern learned from experience. In other words, one can say that reasoning refers to an approach to solve a problem based on rational thought, whereas intuition is more related to gut feeling or ‘thinking without thinking’ (Abernethy, Maxwell, Miller, & Jackson, 2012). While reasoning and intuition are not considered as conflicting, but instead as complementary cognitive processes that contribute to performance (Sio & Ormerod, 2009), there has been limited work done on investigating how these two cognitive processes can be applied to real-world tasks. \n\nIn this paper, we are interested in how reasoning and intuition can be used to solve an IQ task. In particular, we focus on how intuitive thinking (e.g., “thinking without thinking”)"}

Since the numbers 5 and 13 are not factors of 12, we cannot just divide both sides of the equation by 5. In order to find an equality, we need to change the equation into a format where we can divide by both sides. We can do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives us the equation\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &=5\\\\\nx -12 &=5 - 12\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nIf we divide both sides of the equation by 5, we can solve for $x$.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x}{5} &=\\frac{5}{5}\\\\\n\\frac{x - 12}{5} &=1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNow, in order to find the number of cups of flour she put in, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5, giving us\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{x - 12}{5}\\times 5 &=1\\times 5"}

How far did the mouse jump?", "correct answer": 31.0, "llm answer": "31", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis problem can be solved using subtraction, addition, and reasoning. It involves identifying and using the given information to find the mouse's jumping distance. The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, and the mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog. To find the distance the mouse jumped, we first need to find the distance the frog jumped. The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 32 inches to the grasshopper's jumping distance of 25 inches to get the frog's jumping distance:\n\n25 inches + 32 inches = 57 inches\n\nNext, we subtract 26 inches from the frog's jumping distance to find the mouse's jumping distance:\n\n57 inches - 26 inches = 31 inches\n\nTherefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches.\n"}

We are given that there are 76 sacks per day and 64 of them are discarded. If there are 50 oranges in each sack and we discard 64 of them then that means that we harvest 76 sacks containing 50 oranges each, or 3800 oranges. \n\nThis is actually pretty straight forward and simple so I'll go ahead and say 99.99999% chance it's correct\n\nThe question asks how many oranges they harvest per day if each sack contains 50 oranges. If there are 76 sacks per day, and they discard 64 of those, then there must be 76 - 64 = 12 sacks remaining. Each sack contains 50 oranges, so the total number of oranges harvested per day is 12 * 50 = 600.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward arithmetic problem, so I'd say the answer is very likely to be correct. The only possible issue is if the question is asking how many oranges they harvest per sack, in which case the answer would be 50 (assuming the other information is correct). But given the wording of the question, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking"}

Considering the keyword ['38'], it could be interpreted as a value in the answer choices. This value can be decomposed as 31 + 6 + 1. However, 6 is too small to be the 6 pencils in one pack, so this decomposition is probably not correct.\nConsidering the keyword ['19'], it could be interpreted as a value in the answer choices. This value is much smaller than 31, 38, or any other choices. Thus, it is likely to be a part of the problem statement.\n\nReasoning to Possible Answer: The keyword ['2 rows'] implies that 19 is the number of pencils in one row, and 31 is the number of rows. We can derive that 19 * 2 = 38. Thus, the answer is probably 38.\n"}

How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "-2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\n# Solution\nI used David's 27+5=32 and Zachary's 17-7=10. And since 32-10=22, 32-22=10. And so I got to answer -2. David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, that's a gain of 22 push-ups. Since Zachary did 17 crunches less than David, that's a loss of 10 crunches. If Zachary did 5 push-ups, his final total is 5-22= -17. If Zachary did 17 crunches, his final total is 17-10=7. Therefore, Zachary's final total of crunches is greater than the push-ups by 7-(-17)=24. \n# Reference to the keywords during reasoning:\n* 27 more push-ups --> gain 22 push-ups\n* 17 crunches --> loss 10 crunches"}

First, the baker made 228 total products, so 228 - 108 = 120 cakes remaining. Since the baker only sold 44 pastries, it must be the case that the baker only had 44 pastries, so the number of pastries remaining must be 61 - 44 = 17.

How many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to the camp?", "correct answer": 574664.0, "llm answer": "574664", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\nWe want to find $777622 - 202958$. To do so, we can add the 202958 with its opposite sign: $777622 - 202958 = 777622 + (-202958)$. Now we can calculate the opposite of 202958 in our head: 202958 is 100 less than 1,000,000, so it's opposite is 100 more than -1,000,000. In other words, the opposite of 202958 is 574664. We can now compute our sum: $777622 + (-202958) = 777622 + 574664 = 1352286$. If you had more experience, you might've noticed that we could've also subtracted the two numbers, 202958 and 777622, in the order of 777622 - 202958 to get -202964.

(because 39.5 dollars is not an option and it has to be an integer.)\nSince Fred already had 60 dollars, he should receive 60 + 40 = 100 dollars from the total money 79 dollars.\nIf Jason made 33 dollars, then Fred made 100 - 33 = 67 dollars.\nIf Fred made 67 dollars, Jason has 79 - 67 = 12 dollars.\nIf Fred made 69 dollars, Jason has 79 - 69 = 10 dollars.\nIf Fred made 70 dollars, Jason has 79 - 70 = 9 dollars.\nSo Jason made either 9, 10, or 12 dollars.\nThe only answer that is in these three numbers is 14 dollars.\nThus, the answer is 14 dollars.\n"}

But Matthew has 23 crackers left. So each person must have got 6+1 crackers (7 crackers in total), which means Matthew gave 31 - 23 = 8 crackers.\n\nExplanation: In this question, we are given the following information: 5 + 31 = 23 + 8. We are also given a series of numbers, 23, 31, and 5. We are told that Matthew had 31 crackers, and he has 23 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends. We need to find out how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we can use a simple equation: 5 + 31 = 23 + x, where x represents the number of crackers that Matthew gave to his friends. We can simplify this equation by adding 31 to both sides: 5 + 31 + 31 = 23 + x + 31. This gives us 36 = 23 + x + 31. From here, we can subtract 23 from both"}

{"question": "There were 53 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 91 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 14 dollars left. How much more money did she spend at the supermarket than she collected at the atm?", "correct answer": 39.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.96, "probing response": "96%\n\nQ: For the reasoning, is it based on mathematical proof? If not, how can the reasoning be made more accurate or more solid?\nThe reasoning is based on the keywords '53' '14', '91','more''money'. The'more' can be interpreted as 'greater than', hence the reasoning can be rewritten as: x>53. The first line of the question is \"There were 53 dollars in Olivia's wallet.\" We don't know what she does next, so I just put x as she might spend or collect other money and then we have 53+x dollars in her wallet. The second line \"She collected 91 more dollars from an atm.\" so we know 53+x=91. Similarly, the last line \"After she visited a supermarket there were 14 dollars left\" and we have x-14=53. Hence, 53+91=144 and x=144. Therefore, the answer to this question is the difference between the amount of money she spends and the amount of money she collects. So, 144-91=53, which is the money left in the supermarket.\nThe reasoning can be more accurate by using keywords, such as'more money', 'less','sp"}

This implies that there are 94 pickers. Therefore, the number of pickers per day can be obtained by dividing 94 pickers by 6 days, which is 15.6. This is not a whole number, so we cannot have 15 pickers per day, because we cannot have a fraction of a picker. Therefore, we can deduce that there is at least 15 pickers per day. Additionally, the text mentions that the pickers fill 90 drums of grapes in 6 days, and the text mentions 94 pickers. This implies that 90 drums of grapes is a whole number and cannot be a fraction.

{"question": "10 red peaches and some more green peaches are in the basket. If there are a total of 15 peaches in the basket. How many green peaches are in the basket?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\n# Reasoning\nConsidering only these 2 statements, we cannot be sure if red and green peaches are not the same colour or not. So there could be 2 cases:\n- Green and red are the same colours, in which case all the 15 peaches are red.\n- Green and red are different colours, in which case there are 10 red and 5 green peaches.\n\nIt is more likely the peaches are 2 different colours since'red' is used in a sentence and it is more specific than 'peaches' which can refer to red, green, and even yellow peaches.\n\nWe also see the phrase 'if there are' in the second statement. In a conditional sentence, we should try to use the information from the condition part to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nGiven 10 red peaches, if there are only red peaches in the basket, then the basket will contain at least 10 peaches. However, since we know there are a total of 15 peaches in the basket, the basket will definitely contain both red and green peaches.\n\nThis means there are more than 5 green peaches in the basket.\n\n# Final Answer\nSince there are more than 5 green peaches in"}

It's unclear what is meant by \"people in the school\". It could be people including students, it could be people including teachers and students, or it could be just the teachers. The keywords that you provide also don't really help to disambiguate the question. In particular, it seems that \"people\" and \"students\" are equivalent terms here, but I think that's not correct. My reasoning would go as follows:\n\n**If \"people\" means everyone in the school (including students)**:\n\n* There are 315 girls in the school\n* There are 309 boys in the school\n* There are 772 teachers in the school\n* So there are `315 + 309 + 772 = 1396` people in the school\n\n**If \"people\" means everyone in the school (including students)**:\n\n* There are 315 girls in the school\n* There are 309 boys in the school\n* There are 772 teachers in the school\n* So there are `315 + 309 + 772 = 1396` people in the school\n\n**If \"people\" means just the teachers**:\n\n* There are"}
