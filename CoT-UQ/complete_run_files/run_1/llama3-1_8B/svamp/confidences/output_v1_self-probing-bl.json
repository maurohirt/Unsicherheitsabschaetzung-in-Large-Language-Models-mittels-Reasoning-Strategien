Then, 84-30=54 children got off the bus.\n\nThen, we have 54 children got off the bus and 82 children got on the bus. Then we have 82-54=28 children that got on the bus more than those that got off the bus.\n\nSo, 28 children that got on the bus more than those that got off the bus.\n\nSo the answer to the question is -2.

In the case of the random sampling method, it is assumed that we are choosing elements randomly from a pool of options. In this case, we are choosing files or apps from the pool of 24 files and 13 apps. Since we know that the solution is in the form of a multiple-choice question, we can use a probability tree to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the tree. We have 24 files and 13 apps, so there are 37 total options. There are also 6 possibilities for the answer: 3 files were deleted, 2 files and 1 app were deleted, 1 file and 2 apps were deleted, 1 file and 1 app were deleted, or no files or apps were deleted. We can use a tree to represent this, where the branches represent the different possible outcomes and the numbers at the end of each branch represent the probability of that outcome occurring.\n\nUsing this tree, we can find the probability of the different outcomes.

So the question above is very easy.\n\nIn this question, 9 shirts in yesterday is just like 12 hours, and 8 shirts today is like 8 hours. 8 hours plus 12 hours is 20 hours. However, there are only 24 hours. That is, the machine worked for 4 hours yesterday and today, but today worked only for 8 hours.\n8 hours is half of 16 hours (8+8). There are 2 minutes in one hour. So 16 hours is 32 minutes. 8 hours is half of 32 minutes. 16 minutes is 4 hours.\nThere are only 24 hours in 24 hours. 4 hours plus 4 hours is 8 hours.

How many cookies would you have?", "correct answer": 2173.0, "llm answer": "2173", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\n\nThe following students' work is provided to help explain the reasoning process. \n1. The first step would be to divide the number of bags by 4. We can see that 53 bags divided by 4 is 13.25 bags. This means that you will have 13 whole bags and.25 of a bag. \n2. Next we multiply 41 cookies by 13 and add.25. This tells us that there are 533 and.25 cookies in 13 bags. \n3. Since 4 bags equals 53 cookies, we can then divide 533 and.25 by 4. This tells us that there are 133 and 1/4 cookies in 53 bags. \n4. Now we add 133 and 1/4 to the original 53 cookies. This gives us 186 cookies. \n5. Next, we multiply 53 by 4 to find how many cookies there are in 4 bags. 4 bags contain 212 cookies. \n6. Finally, we add 186 and 212 to get our final answer of 398 cookies."}

The first chapter is 66 pages long the second chapter is 35 pages long and the third chapter is 24 pages long. How many pages does the book have altogether?\n\nThe question asks us to find the number of pages in a book. We're given that there are 3 chapters in the book, and that each chapter has a specific number of pages. To solve this problem, we need to use basic arithmetic operations to find the total number of pages in the book.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of pages in the first two chapters:\n\n66 + 35 = 101 pages\n\nNext, let's find the total number of pages in the last chapter:\n\n24 + 101 = 125 pages\n\nTherefore, the total number of pages in the book is 125.\n\nWe can also confirm this answer using multiplication:\n\n66 \\* 3 = 198\n35 \\* 3 = 105\n198 + 105 = 303\n\nThis means that the total number of pages in the book is 303, which is equal to 125 + 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the total number of pages in the book is 125 pages."}

Could you please help me write an argument in favor of this probability being at least 95%?\n\nA: The only way for the answer to be incorrect is for a bed to have a number of seeds different from the stated 10. This would happen if we planted 10 seeds per bed with a probability of 1/45 or approximately 2.2%. Since each bed has an independent probability of having incorrect seeds, there is a probability of 10*2.2% = 22% for any bed having incorrect seeds and 78% of them having correct seeds. This probability is higher than the 95% confidence level, therefore the answer is correct."}

{"question": "They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 4 sets of tables and each set has 3 chairs. If a total of 14 people will attend the party. How many more chairs will they have to buy?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2 chairs", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning:\nBecause it says \"set\" and set has 3 chairs, so 4 sets have 4*3=12 chairs. Then I just add 12 to 14, I get 26. And because the question says that they already have 4 sets of tables, I subtract 4 sets from 26, so I get 22.

I think the answer is 460 since there are 9 books and 46 magazines on each bookshelf, so we can think of the total amount of magazines as being the total amount of books and magazines, which is 9+46=55. Since there are 10 bookshelves, we can multiply 55 by 10, which gives us 55*10=550, which is the total amount of magazines, and since the total amount of books was 9*10=90, then the total amount of magazines must be 550-90=460."}

{"question": "There are 7 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. How many green peaches are in the baskets altogether?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "84", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: The probability to randomly get a green peach from a basket is 1/12 (2 out of 10 + 2), so the probability to get green peaches from one basket is 4/12 (2*2). And 7 baskets will give us 28/12 = 2.333.\n\nBut what about the order in which we choose baskets? We might choose a basket containing 2 green peaches, then another one, and so on. But since the probability for that case to occur is 2*2/12*12 = 1/36, it means there are other combinations that will give us the same result. We have to sum up all those combinations. The formula for that is 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35. So 2.333*35 = 81.715. Therefore, the probability for the answer to be correct is 100-81.715 = 18.29%.\n\nBut 2.333 is the probability for 84 to be the right answer. We need to calculate the probability for 84 to be the right answer instead, which is 1 / 100 (0.01829 + 1). So the right answer"}

Thus the frog hops 18 inches farther than the grasshopper. i.e., $d_{F} = d_{H} + 18$. Also, the mouse hops 2 inches farther than the frog. i.e., $d_{M} = d_{F} + 2 = d_{H} + 20$. The mouse jumps 2 inches farther than the frog. i.e., $d_{M} = d_{F} + 2 = d_{H} + 20$. Thus, $d_{H} = 25$, $d_{F} = 43$, $d_{M} = 45$. So the mouse hops $d_{M} = 45$ inches.\nThus, answer is 45.\nSince grasshopper and mouse are not independent of each other, we will assume that they are independent (this assumption will not affect the conclusion).\nWe note that each frog randomly hops with $d_{F}$ where $d_{F} \\sim N(\\mu_{F},\\sigma"}

So how many cups of sugar and salt do we need? We can use a guess and check or set up an equation. I am going to use the guess and check method.\n\nIf Mary has 6 cups of flour, 7 cups of salt and 8 cups of sugar then we would get a ratio of: $\\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{8}{x}$ We would get 11.4 cups of sugar. If we check that with 5 cups of flour, 7 cups of salt and 11.4 cups of sugar we would not get a true ratio.

{"question": "The ring toss game at the carnival made 120 dollars in the first 20 days and 66 dollars in the remaining 16 days.

In 16 days, the ring toss game at the carnival made 66 dollars. That means it made 4 dollars a day on average. In the first 20 days, then, the ring toss game at the carnival would make 20x4=80 dollars, and it made 120 dollars, so the difference between these two numbers, or 40 dollars, represents how much money it lost in the first 20 days. That means that it lost 2 dollars a day on average in the first 20 days. Since they had an average loss of 2 dollars a day in the first 20 days and an average profit of 4 dollars a day in the remaining 16 days, it must have had an average profit of 1 dollar a day in the first 20 days.

{"question": "At the arcade Dave had won 13 tickets. If he used 8 to buy some toys and 18 more to buy some clothes.

If he used 13 to buy tickets, that means he used 13 tickets. The difference between 26 and 13 is 13. If we have two numbers x and y such that x – y = 13, then it is possible to have y = x + 13.\nTherefore, he bought 13 + 13 = 26 tickets in total. The difference between 18 and 8 is 10.

Let's make up some random numbers:\nn (bottle caps) = 5\nn (wrappers) = 20\n5 + 20 = 25, too small\nLet's try another one:\nn (bottle caps) = 10\nn (wrappers) = 35\n10 + 35 = 45, too small\nLet's try again:\nn (bottle caps) = 15\nn (wrappers) = 45\n15 + 45 = 60, too small\nI see the pattern: every time we try to get more bottle caps, we have to get less wrappers. It must be:\nn (bottle caps) = 11\nn (wrappers) = 28\n11 + 28 = 39, close but still too small\nSo we should get 17 more wrappers and we get 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers.\n```Confidence: "}

A very simple example of this is a card game where a player is dealt a hand of five cards. If there are 52 cards, then there are 2,598,960 possible hands, but the player knows that her hand contains three aces. Given this, the player knows that the probability that she has four aces given that she has three aces is one in 1,287.\nIf \\(P(A \\cap B) \\gt 0\\), then the conditional probability of \\(A\\) given \\(B\\) is\n$$ P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nA common application of conditional probability is the Bayes’ Theorem.

The third sentence tells us that John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups. So Zachary did 15 push-ups, while John did 45 push-ups.

How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 102.0, "llm answer": "153", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation:\nThe book contains 612 pages and Frank finished 612 pages in 6 days. This means that Frank reads 612/6=102 pages per day. As there are 612 pages in the book, the number of pages in each chapter is 612/24=25.5 (rounded down to 25). In order to read all 25.5 pages in a chapter, Frank would have to read at least 25 pages. However, as Frank reads 102 pages per day, he is more likely to read more than 25 pages per chapter. He would have read 5 chapters in a day (102/25.5). However, since the book has 24 chapters and Frank finished in 6 days, he would have read at most 24/6=4 chapters a day. Thus, it is possible that he read 3 chapters and 25 pages in the last day, which means he would have read 4 chapters and 100 pages. So, it is possible that he read 25+100=125 pages per day. As the pages are equally distributed over 24 chapters, it would be the case that he read 25 pages per chapter. Thus, the answer is 125 pages per"}

How many baskets of peaches are there?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nExplanation: As it says on the question there are 10 peaches distributed among some baskets. This means there could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 baskets. 10 is not an option, so there are 9 possible answers. If you randomly chose an answer, you have a 1/9 or 11.1% chance of choosing the correct answer. So, the probability of you choosing the correct answer is only 11.1% and that is a low probability. Therefore, I think that there is a 20% chance that my answer is correct, which is a low probability."}

If your reasoning is based on your personal experience, it would be interesting to see the background on how you came up with your reasoning.\n\nA: As I recall my high-school math lessons, I have the following idea:\n\n1. All numbers are greater than zero. Thus, any number multiplied with itself will always result in a number greater than zero.\n2. All numbers are greater than zero. Thus, any number multiplied with itself will always result in a number greater than zero. Thus, all numbers are positive.\n3. We can assume that the numbers in the problem statement are positive integers.\n4. If the question is \"how many cakes would baker still have\", the answer cannot be negative. Thus, the answer has to be a positive integer.\n5. If the answer is a positive integer, it must be a positive integer greater than zero. That's the case for 15.\n6. 15 is the only positive integer greater than zero in the answer choices.\n7. Therefore, the answer is 15.\n\nThe argument does not seem very rigorous, but at least there is an argument to support the answer."}

How many planks does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe problem requires a lot of information and I want to try to write out a more in-depth explanation of the process.\n\nFor each plank of wood, John uses 74 nails. So the total number of nails used is equal to 8 * 74 = 592.\n\nJohn has 592 nails. Each plank of wood uses 74 nails. The only other piece of information we have is that there are 8 planks in the wall.\n\nFor example, if John has 592 nails and each nail takes up the same space, then the number of planks needed is $\\frac{592}{74} = 8$.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is that the number of planks is equal to the amount of nails (592) divided by the number of nails used in each plank (74)."}

In order to determine Jessie's total weight loss we have to add up her total weight loss which would be 56 kilograms + 99 kilograms = 155 kilograms. This gives us her total weight loss which is her starting weight (92 kilograms) minus her total weight loss (155 kilograms). Therefore her new weight would be 92 kilograms - 155 kilograms which is -63 kilograms.\n\nQ: How many distinct positive divisors does 120 have?\nPossible Answer: 16\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

{"question": "Jesse's room is 7 feet wide. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet.

So I take the square root of both sides (since width and length is the same) to get 14.2 feet (square root of 14). That means I need a carpet that's 14.2 feet long. But, it doesn't quite fit in width. I have to round down to 14 feet, which is 0.286 feet long.

Therefore, when we have 22 green peaches and 11 baskets, the most number of peaches we can have in any single basket is 22 as well.

We could count them to get 10 as the answer. However, we might forget to count or we might have counted them wrongly. As such, we may be uncertain of the answer being 10. Therefore, we would need to consider the likelihood of the answer being 10. For the question above, there are 4 emails sent in the morning but 2 were sent in the afternoon. This would suggest that Jack has sent more emails in the morning. As such, the answer of 10 would not be as likely compared to the answer of 4.

{"question": "In Haley's class 4 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley has 23 marbles and wants to keep 15 marbles for herself. How many will each of the boys receive?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "23", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nI will show the reasoning:\nThe Haley's class 4 is a group of 23 boys and she has 23 marbles. She wants to keep 15 and give the rest to them. We want to calculate what fraction of marbles each person receives, and thus what fraction of the number of boys receives.\nEach person receives $\\frac{23-15}{23} = \\frac{8}{23}$ of the marbles, which is $\\frac{8}{23}$ of the number of boys. To get $\\frac{8}{23}$ of the number of boys we want to multiply it by the number of boys, i.e., $\\frac{8}{23} \\times 23 = 8$.\nEach of the boys receives 8 marbles.\n\nA.

How many crackers did each person eat?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\nIf we assume Matthew gave equal amounts of crackers and cakes to each person, then the amount of crackers each person eat is 22 / 11 = 2.\nHowever, the answer is not one of the options, so we assume Matthew did not give equal amounts of crackers and cakes to each person.\nThen we have to try every option, starting with 22. If the answer is not 22, try 11, if it is not 11, try 3 and so on.\nFor option 22, we have to find the possible combinations of the rest of the crackers and cakes. Since 22/3 = 7 with remainder 1, so we know that the numbers of crackers is 3 times more than the numbers of cakes, which is 22. Therefore, the number of cakes is 7.\nIf we try 7 + 1 = 8, the combination is 8 and 3. The number of crackers is 1 more than the number of cakes, so it is not 3 times more than the number of cakes, so it is not possible.\nIf we try 7 + 2 = 9, the combination is 9 and 2. The number of crackers is 4"}

How many seats are in each bus?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "92", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nExplanation:\nThere are many ways that this problem could be set up and solved. For instance, since the first part of the question says \"if all buses are full\", we can assume that there are the same number of buses as there are classrooms. Since there are 17 classrooms, there must be 17 buses, each with 46 students.\nFrom there, we can find out how many seats there are in each bus. Since we have found out that there are 17 buses and 46 students in each bus, we can multiply 17 and 46 together, giving us 806 seats in each bus. This would be our final answer, 806.\n\n"}

How would you explain that to Bobby?\nAnswer:\n7 is the best answer of the four choices given, because it is correct. The best way to tell Bobby why 7 is not correct is to ask him how many pieces of candy he ate if he ate 7 pieces. If he responds with 30-7 = 23, then he is correct, but otherwise he isn't.\n\nQ: How did you come to this answer?\nAnswer:\nIn order to solve this problem, we need to subtract the pieces of candy that Bobby ate (23) from the total pieces of candy that Bobby had (30).

Since there are 10 broken seats, there are 8 seats that can hold people. Therefore, we should take the number of people on the Ferris wheel, which is equal to 15 times the number of the working seats. Hence, the number of people on the Ferris wheel is equal to 15 times 8, which is 120.\n\nHence, we conclude that the number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time is 120.

How many goldfish remained?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation: We need to use our intuitive understanding of probability here. 5 out of 15 were eaten, so the remaining goldfish would be the ones that were not eaten. So we subtract the eaten goldfish from 15. \n\nTo solve with a mathematical approach, you can use the formula for probability: P(success) = # of successes / total # of trials. The number of successes is 10, so we plug that in. \n\nSince there are 15 goldfish, we find the number of trials by subtracting the number of eaten fish. 10 - 5 = 5. \n\nTo find the probability, we have: P(success) = 10/5. However, we can cancel out the 5s since 10/5 = 2/1. We conclude that the probability of 10 to be the correct answer is 80%.\n"}

If there were 41 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nSolution: This is a simple problem of logic, and can be solved in several ways. One way would be to make a list of all the bird families, and then eliminate one family for each that migrates in the winter.\nThe first family that migrates leaves one family behind. After that, the second family that migrates leaves two families behind. And so on, up until the 27th family that migrates, which leaves 14 families behind. Therefore the answer is 14.\n\nSolution: This problem can also be solved by algebra. Suppose that F is the number of families that fly away for the winter, and B is the number of families that remain. The total number of families is the sum of the number that leave and the number that stay: T = F + B = 41.\nThe question then asks how many families are left after F families have left. The answer is B. So B = F + B – F = 41 – F.\n\nFor example, if F = 27, then B = 41 – 27 = 14. If F = 25, then B = 41 – 25 = 16, etc."}

When asked \"Jack received 4 emails in the morning and some more in the afternoon. If he received a total of 5 emails in the day, how many emails did Jack receive in the afternoon?\", we assume that Jack received at least 1 email in the afternoon because we know that Jack received 5 emails in total and we know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning. There is no point in solving this question if you assume that Jack received 0 or 2 or 3 emails in the afternoon. In conclusion, we assume that Jack received at least 1 email in the afternoon.

Therefore, there are 5 people who visited and 4 people who did not. On the previous day, if one of them did not visit the palace, the other 5 must have. Therefore, there are 5 people who visited and 1 who did not. Therefore, 5/5 of the previous day's visitors visited and 5/6 of Rachel's day visitors visited.
