If we can figure out the size of the sample space and the number of events in the sample space, then we can find the probability of each event. In the case of this question, we can first enumerate all the possible outcomes in the sample space: \n\n- (Marin and Donald have 11 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 10 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 9 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 8 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 7 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 6 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 5 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 4 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 3 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 2 apples)\n- (Marin and Donald have 1 apple)\n- (Marin and Donald have 0 apple)\nSo the size of the sample space is 12.

If we remove five slices from the top and the remaining slices are three then the number of slices of cake in the original cake must have been 8. But the question didn't mention if the oranges are added and taken in the same order. So, we can only assume that it may have been 8. But, since there is nothing mentioned about the order, the answer cannot be known for sure. Therefore, the answer must be 3.\n\nPlease explain clearly with mathematical symbols the reasoning you have used in your answer.\n\nExplanation:\nSuppose I want to order the cake slices in a basket.

How much money did she have left?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\n\nQ: Please explain why you answer this question with that number.\n\n\nAnswer: We need to analyze the problem and reason from a logical standpoint. When Hilt bought a pencil for 11 cents she had 15 cents less the cost of a pencil, which is 4 cents. In order to solve the problem, we must reason about the problem. Hilt had 15 cents and bought a pencil for 11 cents, therefore she has 4 cents left. We could solve it mathematically by subtracting 11 from 15, but reasoning allows us to approach the problem with a logical mindset and helps us reach the answer without using the mathematical method. By doing so, the answer would be reached more quickly without any difficulty. We need to think about the logical standpoint and reason in order to reach the correct answer. The initial money Hilt had was 15 cents and she bought a pencil for 11 cents. This leaves her with 4 cents left. So the answer is 4. We can reach this answer by reasoning about the problem and the given information.\n\nQ: How would you use a graph to solve this question?\nAnswer: I would graph out the money Hilt had, the cost of the pencil, and the remaining amount"}

How many pieces of candy did Mrs. Hilt give away?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "18", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nI'll elaborate the above reasoning in words as follows:\n* First, there are 10 candies in total.\n* The most critical reasoning step above only allows us to conclude that the number of candies each student received cannot be less than 2. For example, it cannot be the case that Mrs. Hilt gave 1 candy to each student.\n* Second, from the reasoning above, the number of candies each student received has to be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n* Third, the number of candies each student received cannot be 2, 4, 5, or 6. Because then the total number of candies would be an even number, but we know there are 9 students (which is odd) in total.\n* Therefore, the number of candies each student received must be 3.\n\nSo there are 3 candies left after giving candies to all the 9 students.\nAnd since Mrs. Hilt gave 2 candies to each student, the answer is:\n9 x 2 + 3 = 18\n\nComment 1:\nThe problem is a little tricky because it has a small gap.

Considering the additional information, we can easily conclude that the answer 11 balloons is correct. However, the answer 7 balloons is also possible if the information is only for the morning balloons. Therefore, there are two possible answer in total. The probability of answer 11 balloons is 1/2. If we don't consider the additional information, we have a probability of 1/3 that the answer is 11 balloons.

We need to calculate the number of stickers Pat had at the end of the week (day 7) by subtracting the number of stickers Pat had on the first day (day 1) from the total number of stickers Pat had at the end of the week (day 7). For the first day, we know that Pat had 39 stickers. For the end of the week, we know that Pat had 22 more stickers, but we do not know how many stickers Pat had in total. We can assume that Pat had 61 stickers in total, which is the most frequent answer choice. However, if Pat did not have 22 more stickers by the end of the week, then the answer would be incorrect. To calculate the probability of answer 61 to be correct, we need to know how many stickers Pat had in total at the end of the week (day 7).

We also know that the lengths of the ropes for the posts were tied together in the following order: 24, 20, 14, and 12. To determine the total length of the ropes, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence: S_n = a(1-r^n)/1-r, where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a = 24, r = (20/24), and n = 4. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: S_n = 24(1-(20/24)^4)/1-(20/24) = 24(1-160/256)/-1/4 = 24(-96/256) = -24(-6/4) = -24(3/2) = -36.

The other mistake is to count 195 directly. This one is hard because 195 is indeed a good approximation to 391, but not the correct answer.\n- After showing the result of 391, the total, people will more likely choose 195 as the correct answer, because 195/391=0.5, which is a perfect balance. However, this is a very bad way of thinking.\n- In fact, what we need to figure out is what happens when people agree to this decision. If there are 391 people, the number of people who support the decision, which is 391, should be higher than 50% of 391, which is 195.5. The actual answer could be 196, 197, 195, 194, 195.5, or 196.5.

Therefore, we simply take 532 (the total number of species) - 253 (the number of insect species) - 143 (the number of bird species) to get the number of reptile species.\n\nThe most reasonable answer would be 136. The confidence would be 95%. This is because in this question, we have 532 species (we can't know if this is 535 species or 534), 253 insects, and 143 birds.

How many chickens do they have in total?", "correct answer": 540.0, "llm answer": "540", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation: My reasoning is as follows. We can infer that the total number of chicken is not divisible by 9 (because if there are 9 coops then there will be 9 × 60 = 540 chickens). So it is possible that the actual number of chickens is 8 × 60 = 480 but since the question specifically asked for chickens in total, it is very likely that it is not 480. So, we are left with 540, 570, 600 as possible answers. Now, since the answer choices are in increments of 20, I'm more likely to select the answers divisible by 20, such as 540, 560, 580 and 600 as correct. So, 540 is not the only possibility but is the most likely answer based on my reasoning.\n"}

{"question": "There are 397 butterflies. Each butterfly has 12 black dots and 17 yellow dots. How many black dots are there in all?", "correct answer": 4764.0, "llm answer": "204", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\n### 2 thoughts on “Question 28”\n\n1. The question is pretty poorly written. It is unclear whether the 397 butterflies have a total of 12+17 = 29 black and yellow dots, or whether each butterfly has 12 black dots and 17 yellow dots, which means the total of all 397 butterflies is 4,844 black dots and 6,729 yellow dots. Based on the question as written, I assume the latter is true and the total number of dots of any color is 11,573. Thus there are 12*12 = 144 black dots per square and 12*17 = 204 black dots in a 12*17 grid.\nThe answer can only be incorrect if there is a bug in the program used to generate the image.\n\n• I edited the question. I hope it’s clear now. Thanks!"}

Here we need to find a number greater than 28. The obvious choice is to find a multiple of 28, because 28 is a multiple of 2, and 7. 7 is a prime number, so 28 is not a multiple of any other prime number. As a result, the multiple of 28 is a perfect multiple of 28, and adding the perfect multiple to 28 results in a number that is also perfect. The perfect multiple of 28 that is larger than 28 is 14*28 = 392, and the result number is 420. That is 392+28. We can use this reasoning to answer the question. We just need to find a multiple of 28 larger than 28. The closest number to 28 is 28*1=28. We need to find"}

Then multiplied by 3, to get $1.02. 0.34 X 3 = $1.02. So i thought of the answer being $1.02\n\nExplanation:\nThe given answer is correct. As, we know that the price of one stamp is $0.34, the price of 2 stamps will be $0.34 + $0.34 =$0.68, the price of 3 stamps will be $0.68 + $0.34= $1.02 and the price of 4 stamps will be $1.02 + $0.34 = $1.36. So the given answer is $1.36.\nExplanation:\nThe question is asking how much a 4th stamp costs in total, not just on its own. If the cost of each stamp remains the same, we can just multiply the 4 by the cost of a single stamp: 4 x 0.34 = 1.36\n\nExplanation:\nIn such questions where the cost of each stamp is the same, it is better to start with the cost of 1 stamp"}

How many envelopes does Kiera have in all?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "46", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: The correct answer can be calculated in a straightforward way with three equations and three unknowns.\n```x + y = 14 \ny = 14 - x\nz = 3y \nx + y + z =? ```\n\nThe 3 unknowns are the numbers of blue, yellow and green envelopes. If we just focus on the yellow and green envelopes, then we are essentially dealing with a two unknowns system, and we can simply take a number for x (number of blue envelopes) and find out y (number of yellow envelopes) and z (number of green envelopes). If you find y = 6, z = 18, then you can conclude that the sum of all the envelopes must be 14 + 6 + 18 = 38.\nThe reason we can do so is because the number of blue envelopes does not affect the relationship between the yellow envelopes and green envelopes. With this in mind, we can also make a table where we input the possible values of x and solve the system of equations in the second column. We have no way of knowing the exact value of x, but we can easily get a good range of values by taking the upper limit of 6 yellow envelopes. \n```[x"}

How many stamps did Zeshaun buy in all?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n# Reasoning Explanation:\n\nThere are 3 types of stamps, snowflake, truck and rose, denoted by $S$, $T$ and $R$ respectively. The number of each stamp $S$, $T$ and $R$ bought by Zeshaun are known as the variables of the problem. In order to calculate the number of stamps bought by Zeshaun in total, we need to first find the value of $S$, $T$ and $R$. The question states that $T = S + 5$ and $R = T - 2$. Substituting the value of $T$ in $R$, we have $R = S + 5 - 2$ or $R = S + 3$. It is known that $S = 3$. Substituting the value of $S$ in $R$, we get $R = 3 + 3$ or $R = 6$. It is also known that $T = S + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8$. Sum of all the three variables, $S$, $T$ and $R$ will be $3 + 8 + 6 = 17$.\n\n# Solution"}

What I'm doing is checking what happens when I take the 0.60 from 2 mugs, then 0.75 from 2 mugs, then 0.60 from 1 mug, and 0.75 from 1 mug. If you take 0.75 from one mug then you would get $-5.70.

How many pencils did each student get?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nExplanation: If we have n students in class, the number of pencils each student can have is n / 42. For example, if there are 3 students in the class, each one of them can have 3/42 = 3/6 = 1/2 pencils.\nSo if we consider this, we can eliminate the 1 answer, as it doesn’t conform to the n / 42 = x for 12. This reduces the answer set to 2, 3, and 4. We can eliminate 2 by considering that there is only 1 more answer after 2 (3) and the one before (1). So the most likely one is 3 and we can only eliminate 3 if it’s actually wrong.\nWe can find out if the answer is wrong if we calculate x for 3 and n. Then if it’s less than 3, it’s definitely wrong, because if 3 students have less than 3 pencils, they must have 1 or 2. But if it’s greater than 3, then we have more possibilities to figure out the right answer. Because if 3 students have more than 3 pencils, they can have either 3 or 4.\nFor"}

If the teacher gives fewer riddles, then each of the 18 students still need to guess the same number of riddles. The way to figure this out is that the teacher must distribute riddles to the students so that the teacher's share of the riddles is a multiple of 18. This way the students all get the same number of riddles. So to figure out the answer you need to figure out the LCM of 18 and 389. \n\nThis process is called the LCM because the \"least common multiple\" is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. In this case, that number is 702. However, we only want to distribute more riddles, so we want a multiple of 702 that is greater than 389. The next multiple after 702 is 1,404. So the teacher needs to distribute 702+702=1404 riddles for this to work. \n\nWe can check that 1404 is divisible by 18, because 1404/18=78. We can check that 1404 is also divisible by 389, because 140"}

Then 108 can be doubled to 216 and 216 can be doubled to 432. And 432 can be doubled to 864. 864 can be doubled to 1728. 1728 can be doubled to 3456. And 3456 can be doubled to 6912. 6912 can be doubled to 13824. And 13824 can be doubled to 27648.\n\nThis reasoning is correct because Ricky would see all of the money that Ricky had put in the magic money box up to that point. If Ricky put 3 pennies on Monday, the magic money box would double it on Tuesday, so there would be 6 pennies in it on Wednesday. Then the magic money box would double it on Thursday, so there would be 12 pennies in it on Friday.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it is very likely that the answer 24 is correct."}

How many whole cookies did Greg's mom make?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nExplanation:\nFor a whole cookie, 2 halves is needed. The problem is about \"how many whole cookies,\" so we need to see how many halves can form 2 pieces. Greg ate 4 halves and his brother, Brad, had 6 halves. There were 18 halves left. Let's try to see what we can get with 4, 6, 18. We will need 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 halves to make 14 whole cookies, which is 4 more than what we know the halves to be. We know that \"how many whole cookies\" is Greg's mom's cookies. We also know that \"how many halves\" is Greg's and Brad's halves, so the 4 more halves cannot be in the answer.

How many children were on the track team then?", "correct answer": 36.0, "llm answer": "21 children", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation: Given 18 girls and 15 boys, so the total is 33. If 7 more girls joined and 4 boys quit, the new total is $18 + 7 + 15 - 4 = 36$, which does not match any of the choices. The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is $15 - 4 = 11$. We can use the original numbers to make $11$ the total of girls and boys, which is $18 + 11 = 29$ and it does not match the answer choices. However, in some other situations, this is possible. Therefore, we may need more information to make sure. Let's take one more step. If 4 boys quit the team, that means the total would be less than $15 - 4 = 11$, so the only possible answer is 21, 29, 33, and 37. But the question is: \"how many children were on the track team then?\", so we can rule out 33 and 37, and 21 seems to be the answer. The confidence would be 85% or more.\n"}

{"question": "Zachary collects cans for the recycling club. On the first day, he found 4 cans. On the second day, he found 9 cans. He found 14 cans on the third day. If this pattern continues,. how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "22 cans", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\nExplanation:\nAssuming the number of cans follows the same pattern as the 3 numbers, we can set up a recursive function of day to count. $f(day) = f(day-1) + day$ $f(1)=4, f(2)=9, f(3)=14, f(4)=14+3=19, f(5)=19+4=23, f(6)=23+5=28, f(7)=28+6=34$ The total number of cans collected by Zachary on the seventh day will be $34$.\nI think the problem is a little bit too easy for the difficulty rating of 800. This problem looks more like a 600-700 level question."}

Therefore x must be 17 pages. \n\n# Justification\nTo solve for x, we have three equations:\n- 15 pages + 16 pages = x pages - 18 pages\n- x pages - 15 pages = 16 pages\n- x pages - 18 pages = 15 pages + 16 pages\n\nThe sum of the first two equations is the third, but I did not notice this because of the negative sign on the second equation. I solved the equations individually as follows, to get three possibilities for x:\n- x pages - 18 pages = 15 pages + 16 pages\n- x = 15 + 16 - 18 pages = 13 pages\n\n- x pages - 15 pages = 16 pages\n- x = 16 - 15 pages = 1 page\n\n- x pages - 18 pages = 15 pages + 16 pages\n- x = 15 + 16 - 18 pages = 13 pages\n\nWith"}

I need to find the number of beanie babies she started with to make all of those things true. So, I need to figure out how many beanie babies she gave to her cousin. I know that she gave 4 beanie babies to her sister. I don't know if she gave any more than that to her sister, but I know that she gave a half of that to her sister. This means that she gave more than 4 beanie babies to her cousin because there's no way that she would give 8 beanie babies to her cousin, and only 4 beanie babies to her sister, if she only had 12 beanie babies.

However, we only have information of the number of students Mrs. Randall is currently teaching.\nI would argue that in order to get the answer of 3rd grade, we must assume 1 of two conditions. The first condition is that Mrs. Randall is currently teaching all 3rd grade students in the district. The second condition is that Mrs. Randall is currently teaching a random sample of all the 3rd grade students in the district.\nAssuming the first condition (all 3rd grade students are being taught by Mrs. Randall), if there are 26 students in total, then it is impossible that there were also 26 students in 2nd grade. Because it is impossible to have the same number of students in two grades, I think the answer cannot be 3rd grade and thus I have low confidence in this answer."}

The reason why J.T. lost 14 of them but 45 cards left is that he gave 19 cards to his friend. Now we can know that J.T. has 45 cards before he gave 19 cards to his friend. In other words, J.T. has 45+19=64 cards before he lost 14 cards. Thus the total number of cards J.T. had at first is 64+14=78 cards.

You are assuming the coins are equally distributed (i.e., there are an equal number of quarters and dimes). This is not always the case.\n\nExplanation: There are 48 coins remaining and each coin has a value of 10 cents. The answer can be written as the product of 48 and 10, which is 480. If the correct answer is 19, then there are 19 coins that are worth more than 10 cents. The correct answer is not the correct answer. This answer is not correct. There are 29 quarters and they are worth 290 cents. There are 19 coins left. The total of 290 + 19 is 309. The total of 309 coins is 309 cents. This is not a number that can be evenly divided by 10. The correct answer is 19 coins. The reason this answer is wrong is because 19 is a factor of 29 and 290 is not divisible by 19. There are 48 coins. 48 is a multiple of 19 and so 48 can be evenly divided by 19. Therefore, the correct answer must be 19.\n"}

The number 315 was closest to the prediction, so I reasoned that it was most likely to be correct. However, I reasoned that it might be possible that 12 jerseys could cost even less than 315, so I reasoned that 315 might not be completely certain.

Introduction\n\nOne of the most frequently used tools in data science is the **confidence interval**. In short, confidence intervals are a way to measure the uncertainty in a statistical estimate. A 95% confidence interval is an estimate of the range of values in which the true value of a parameter lies at a 95% confidence level.\n\nThis chapter covers the main concepts and interpretations of confidence intervals, which is essential to many statistical tools.\n\n# 2. The Meaning of Confidence\n\nBefore we get into how to calculate confidence intervals, we must first define what it means for a 95% confidence interval to be correct or incorrect. The term \"correct\" is perhaps a little unfortunate here, since there isn't a clear \"right\" answer. Rather, the correct 95% confidence interval should contain the true population parameter. The confidence level is the probability that the confidence interval contains the true value of the parameter. For a 95% confidence interval, we would expect 95% of such intervals to contain the true value of the parameter. In other words, we expect one out of every 20 confidence intervals to not contain the true value. This is not because there is anything wrong with the calculation of the confidence interval, but just"}

Let X be the number of laps run on Monday. Since the pattern follows the doubling sequence, the number of laps on Friday is N/2. Thus, X+1 should be a number that is divisible by 8 and when divided by 4, leave a remainder of N/2. We conclude N=0. Therefore, the correct answer is 32 laps.\nConfidence: 1"}

{"question": "Tess is writing a poem. She writes 23 words on the first line, 26 words on the second line, 29 words on the third line, 32 words on the fourth line, and 35 words on the fifth line. If this pattern continues,. how many words will Tess write on the sixth line?", "correct answer": 38.0, "llm answer": "38", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nMy reasoning for the above confidence number:\nThe word Tess writes on the first line can be anything in between 1 to 25 (inclusive), and it is equally possible for all those words. So, it is 100/25 = 4% likely for the first line to contain any particular word. \n\nFor any given line, we have 5 possible outcomes (26, 27, 28, 29, 30), and these 5 outcomes are equally possible. For example, for the second line, 26 words could be 1 word in between 1 to 25 (inclusive), 2 words in between 1 to 25 (inclusive), 1 word in between 26 to 50 (inclusive), 2 words in between 26 to 50 (inclusive) and 1 word in between 51 to 75 (inclusive). So, for the first line, the probability of any particular word is 5/100.\n\nThe critical step above means: \"5 words\". We can multiply the 4% and 5% above. So, the probability of any word to appear on the first line is 4*5% = 20%.\n\nLet us try to think this another way. If we"}

{"question": "There were 22 bales of hay in the barn. Keith stacked more bales in the barn today. There are now 89 bales of hay in the barn. How many bales did he store in the barn ?", "correct answer": 67.0, "llm answer": "67", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nThe key to the problem is the word ‘more’, indicating that the bales stored in the barn today are additional to the original 22. Also, the information that 22 + x = 89 provides the critical reasoning step. \n\nThere are two ways to solve the problem. One way is to use algebra to solve for x:\n```\n22 + x = 89\n22 + 67 = 89\nTherefore x = 67\n```\nThis reasoning seems to be quite simple. However, it’s worth noting that this kind of reasoning step might be problematic because it requires algebra skills to solve for x. The other way to solve the problem is to add the original 22 bales to 67 to get 89, which seems to be easier and more direct. I think this way of reasoning can help the candidate understand the problem better, because it uses familiar mathematical concepts and operations. Therefore, I would suggest that the candidate try to find a balance between these two methods. That is, use the second method when the problem involves familiar mathematical concepts and operations, and use the first method when the problem involves less familiar mathematical concepts and operations. I think this approach can help the candidate reason more effectively and efficiently. \n\nConfidence: "}

What additional information will you use to narrow down the possible answer?\nReasoning: 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2 + 1 = 3\nThe critical reasoning step is using the same kind of operation for addition: first, combine 1/2 and 1/2, and then add 1 to the combined value of 1/2 and 1/2.\nThis reasoning can be supported by the additional information of combining 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, so 1 + 1 = 2.\nHowever, we are missing the additional information that Joan is baking a cake. She might already be adding more than 7 cups to the cake. Therefore, the reasoning is not conclusive that she should add another 3 cups.\nFor this question, we are unable to find the additional information that helps us to identify whether 3 cups is the correct answer or not.

We already know that there were 6 roses in the vase before, so it must have been 24 - 6 = 18 roses that Jessica cut.\n\nAnother approach to the same problem:\n* We are trying to find the difference between two numbers:\n* We are told that there were 6 roses in the vase and there are now 18 roses in the vase.\n* Thus we are trying to find 18 - 6 = 12 roses that Jessica cut.\n\nNote that we are trying to find the difference between two numbers (24 - 6 or 18 - 6 = 12 roses). In a subtraction question, it is often important to add or subtract the correct number from the correct number. We can only do this if we clearly identify the two numbers that we are trying to subtract (or add). The numbers that we have been given are"}

The problem is deliberately imprecise and asks you to do something you can't do. The solution asks you to guess, even though you know you can't possibly guess correctly.\n\nQ: If you knew your reasoning to be correct, what would you be certain of, and why? If you knew your reasoning to be incorrect, what would you be certain of, and why?\n\nI think I understand now what the above problem was asking for. The answer was 14.5. The author could have written the problem like this:\n\nQ: Benny sold half of his comic books and then bought 6 more. He now has 17. How many did he begin with?\n\nI would think that this problem would have a unique answer, but I have no confidence in that conclusion. It would be interesting to see how a large group of students solved this problem.\n\n### Answer 1 by Matthew Johnson\n\nI don"}

{"question": "A man is thrice as old as his son. After 12 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find their present ages.", "correct answer": 36.0, "llm answer": "The son is 12 years old and the man is 36 years old.", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nReasoning: The question requires reasoning skills to interpret the information in the answer choice. It's essential to identify that the son's age will increase by 12 in 12 years, while the father's age will increase by x + 12, making x his age now. Since the father is currently thrice as old as the son, x = 3x + 12, and the son's age will be 3x + 12 + 12, making it 5x + 24. This is equivalent to the father being twice as old as the son. Therefore, we have 5x + 24 = 2(x + 12) => 5x + 24 = 2x + 24, which simplifies to x = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 0. The son's age after 12 years is 12 + 0 = 12. The father's age now is 3x + 12 = 3 × 0 + 12 = 12. Thus, the correct answer is The son is 12 years old and the man is 36 years old.\n\nQ: Considering the critical reasoning step as additional information, what is the probability that"}

We know from the problem that Roger's age was 25 ten years ago, which we can interpret as being 25-10 = 15 years younger.

Find the original fraction.", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "1/2", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: From the first sentence, I know that X = N / D, and I know that N = D - 3. From the second sentence, I know that (N + 1) / (D + 3) = 1/2.\nSince N = D - 3, (D - 3) + 1 / (D + 3) = 1/2\nD - 2 / D + 3 = 1/2\n2 D - 4 = D + 3\nD = 7\n\nSince N = D - 3 = 4, this means the original fraction was 4/7. 4/7 is 1/2 when you add 3 to both the numerator and the denominator, so I conclude that 4/7 is the original fraction.

The garden is measured on two edges, which is the width and length. The area of a rectangular garden is the width multiplied by the length.\n\nThe width of the rectangular garden is 10 feet. This is a constant factor, and it does not change, and we can multiply it by all the other variables we have in the equation to get the final answer. The final answer is the area of the rectangular garden in square feet. It is a product of the width and the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The perimeter is 36 feet, which is 4 times the length, where the length can be any number as it does not have an impact on the answer.\n\nIn summary, the length of the rectangular garden is 36 divided by 4 which is 9 feet. We can then multiply 10 by 9 to get the area of the garden which is 90 feet squared. The correct answer to this question is 90, and the confidence is 70"}

How wide is the garden?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "3.2 meters", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\nThe given equation (80=25×w) is a linear equation of two variables, x and y, where y=25, x=w. Since x and y are independent variables, the answer is 3.2, which is the solution to the linear equation. If we assume the answer is not 3.2, we would have to assume that the question has an error. This reasoning process, which uses a counterfactual, is a formal way of reasoning using the Law of the Excluded Middle, which says that an event either occurs or doesn't occur.\nThe answer to this question could have also been reached by assuming that 25 is the length, and that the width is the unknown variable in the equation, which leads to w = 80/25, which reduces to 3.2.\n"}

Since the diameter is two times the radius, then dividing the diameter by two gives us the radius. Then I would apply the relationship by dividing the diameter by two to arrive at the radius. In this case, I will divide 10 by 2 to get 5.

If the total number of people was 177,. about how many people were in each group?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "5.71", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\nWe do not need to know what all 31 groups are, but it is a good idea to think about it.\nSince there are 177 people, there are 31 groups.\nThat means each group is about 177/31 = 5.71 people.\nFor this problem, the number in each group cannot be less than 1. In other words, 177 people cannot be divided by 31 into a fraction of a person in each group.\nThere are a total of 31 groups. The total number of people is 177.\nIf each group is g people, the sum of the groups is 31g = 177.\nTo solve for g, divide both sides by 31 to find g = 177/31 = 5.71, so the most critical step is 177/31 = 5.71.\n\nQ: About how many more people are in the fourth group than in the first group?\n```A. 0.45 people B. 1.12 people C. 0.57 people D. 3.55 people E. 2.83 people```\nPossible Answer: A\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: A (0.45 people)\n"}

If we multiply 8 yards with 5 yards, we get 40 square yards, which is more than 35 square yards. So we have to subtract 1 yard from 7 yards to get the closest number to the given area. Thus we arrive at 7 yards, which will be the closest number to the given area.\n\nConfidence:\nThe confidence we have on this answer is high since this is a unique answer.

My reasoning is that if we have 72 shoes and the ratio of shoes to sandals is 9:5, we should have 4*72/(9+4) sandals, which is 40.\nThis reasoning is flawed because the question only tells us the ratio of the two (i.e. the number of sandals is 5/9 of the number of shoes).

If the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold was 2:1,. what is the combined amount of cats sold?\" is not a ratio problem but a proportion problem. I think it should be 24 cats sold. The key step is to identify the two proportions. The two proportions are \"the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold\" and \"the combined amount of cats sold\". To use the ratio of siamese cats to house cats sold is equal to 2:1, which is 2/1=2, to find the proportion of cats sold, I divide 2 into 24, which is the total number of cats sold. 24/2=12.

The question is pretty straightforward, but we can get it wrong by making an obvious and common mistake.\n# Explanation\nThis question is an example of the trap of \"subtracting denominator\". We are required to solve a ratio problem with only two values given. The first step is to identify that we need to solve a ratio problem, so we should use ratio calculation:\nRatio: (54 - 9) / 9 = 45 / 9\nThe common mistake is to consider the first number 54 as the numerator, but in fact, the number should be considered as 9. So when we subtracted 9 from the numerator, we made an obvious mistake that many of us did. In this problem, this mistake leads to a big gap between two options, which might confuse us that the answer is 5 to 1, but this is not the right way to solve the problem."}

{"question": "Frank had forty-two pieces of candy. If he put them into bags with seven pieces in each bag,. how many bags would he have?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6 bags", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: \n```First, it is important to realize that 42 can be divided by 7 because the number 7 is a factor of 42. This is also because 42 is an even number and the factor of an even number is always an even number. Hence, this critical reasoning step provides the necessary condition for the possibility that 6 bags will be correct. However, this critical reasoning step does not provide a sufficient condition for the possibility that 6 bags will be correct. The reason is that the number 6 bags can be correct only if the number 7 is the only factor of 42 and the number 42 is not a multiple of the factor other than 7. This is because the number 42 is the product of the number 7 and the other number that is equal to the number 42 divided by 7. Therefore, the number 42 is the multiple of the factor other than 7 only if this factor is an odd number, which is not the case here. The possibility that the other number is an odd number can be eliminated because the number 42 is an even number. Thus, the possibility that the factor other than 7 is an odd number can be eliminated. Therefore, the possibility that "}

This is a simple rate problem and we can use a proportion to solve. First, let’s write a proportion that represents the fact that the number of bottles Will has decreases at a rate of 7 bottles per day.\nWe know that there are 28 bottles at the beginning, and so:\nWe know that at the end there are no bottles (Will drank all of them). If we let x = the number of days, we can rewrite the above proportion:\nWe can solve this equation by cross-multiplying:\nNow, the trick is that the problem doesn’t ask us how many days it would take for Will to run out of water, but rather how many days it would take for the number of bottles of water to decrease to 0. In this case, we need to add one to our answer:\nThe answer to the problem, then, is 4 days."}

The answer is the number of stacks. 72 / 8 = 9 stacks of 8 nickels each. Therefore, I believe the answer is 9 stacks of 8 nickels each.\n\nExplanation: ```In the problem, Lana has 72 extra nickels and is trying to put them into stacks of 8.

It is reasonable to assume that the less likely it is to use the clue as additional information, the more likely the clue is the most critical step. In other words, the answer to the above question reflects the plausibility of the clue as the most critical step.\n\n---\nWe can also compute the likelihood of a number to be the number of towels bought by the frequency of the clue in data. For example, in the given clue 27 is the only solution (9 * 3). Thus, the frequency of the clue is 1. Now suppose we have 1000 data. If the clue is in 80% of the data, we have 800 data with a similar clue. 80% is the likelihood that a number (i.e. the number of towels bought) is a solution to the clue. We call this the frequency probability of the clue. In this way, we can estimate the plausibility of the clue as the most critical step by the frequency probability of the clue. In this case, the frequency probability of the clue is 0.8.\n\n---\nThe above reasoning is inspired by the book of \"Cognitive Bias Cheat"}

If they tell you that Adam read 5 books one week and 8 books the next week, then you should assume that Adam read the minimum and maximum number of books for every week in the book series. Then, you’d have 5 x 5 + 8 x 8 = 41 books for the answer. Of course, you can make a similar estimate for all of the possible answers as well (for example, 2 x 5 + 9 x 8 = 92 books). Then you’d be able to use the answer stem (i.e. “how many books did Adam read total”) to eliminate answers that are impossible or highly unlikely, and then you can make an informed guess from there.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nFor this specific question, you could reason this way:\n\nLet’s assume that the question is referring to consecutive weeks.

We have seen that the reasoning process has three steps.\n    - First, we should gather as much information as possible.\n    - Second, we should decide on a strategy for our reasoning.\n    - Third, we should perform the actual reasoning process.\nHere, we saw that the reasoning process is a process of considering information, in order to form a conclusion. We saw that this reasoning process was not simply a matter of thinking about information to decide on a particular answer, but rather that it involved the consideration of information to generate new information and make new conclusions."}

I believe this is a comparison question. We can also treat this as a word problem in which we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown. However, in this problem, the comparison is simpler.\nBehind = 13\n\nWhen we set up an equation, we can set up a proportion: [86-1/86: 73: x], in which x is the answer.\nThus, x = 86*73 / 86 = 73. We need to round the answer. We have a rounding rule for this problem: 4 or 5 is rounded up and other numbers are rounded down. Thus, 73 is rounded down and the answer is 72.\n\nSince we set up a proportion, it is easy to determine that this question is comparing rope jumping.\n\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: Because 73 is only rounded down, we can assume that 73 is less than 74. Because Winnie jumped 86 yesterday and 73 today, she is behind. Thus, we need to know the number of jumps behind 73 to determine the answer. If there are fewer than 73 jumps behind"}

This is simply a question about the starting and ending numbers.\nThis question doesn't give us any information about how many cakes were made. The first number we are given is the number of cakes sold.\nThe question doesn't tell us how many cakes remain, just that 7 remain. So we know that the answer has to be less than 7.\nIf we add 7 to both sides of the equation we get: $x+7=90$, or just $x=90-7$.\n$90-7=83$. This is the answer.\nIt's important to think about why this reasoning was necessary. Why isn't it enough to just say that we can't know that the answer is 7 because we have no information about what $x$ is?\nIf $x$ is 30 and the baker sold 27 of the 90 cakes, then we would know that the answer is 7. That's because 30+27 = 57.\nSo we can't"}

However, I think we can actually make a stronger inference than this because there is another important clue here. I think we should focus on the fact that we're told about 3 dollars for her birthday specifically, which suggests that it's the additional 13 dollars that are important rather than the original amount she already had. I'll explain below why I think this is the case.\nFirst, let's look at what we know about Amy's story so far:\n1. Amy had 2 dollars originally\n2. She got 13 more dollars for doing chores\n3. She also got 3 more dollars for her birthday\n4. The question asks us how much money she has now\nWe can start by trying to answer the question directly using just the information given.

What is the mean of the chocolate bars he sold?", "correct answer": 71.0, "llm answer": "75", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nExplanation: It is unclear to me what the word 'considering' here means. I'm guessing we are just going to use this critical step to check our answer but it's also not clear to me why this reasoning step would be critical since the question doesn't really require us to come up with any answer or argument, it just asks us to use our understanding of the question to think of what Victor would have been doing in this situation.\nI see two possible ways to approach this problem. \n1. Take the mean of all of his sales numbers: (75+67+75+70+68)/5 = 72.4\n2. Take the mean of the first and last two weeks, ignoring the middle week where he sold the least amount of chocolate: (75+75+68)/3 = 72.7\nBoth ways give me a mean of 72.7, so I guess Victor would have sold on average 72.7 chocolate bars each week.\n"}

The problem is, what is the mean of these results? Well, let's look at our answer choices. We're given 5.56. So let's see if that's the correct answer. We need to add these numbers up. And we need to know how many numbers there are. So let's put those values into a table. Then we'll be able to compute the mean by dividing the sum by the number. Let's just do that. We need to figure out how many numbers we have. This is really hard to count, so let's let's add up all the numbers. There are 50 total numbers. And then we add these numbers up. I know you know how to do that. Just put the one next to the 10 and we have a total of 50. So now we can divide this number by 50. We get five point five six. So our answer is five point five six. Now we'll look at the next question. Considering"}

The two traffic lights are going to change every 72 and 108 seconds. The 108 seconds light will be ahead by 36 seconds at the 72 seconds change. They will meet up again at 72+36=108 seconds or 1 minute 48 seconds from the previous meeting. They will repeat this pattern every 2 minutes. At the second minute, the 108 second light will be ahead by 48 seconds. At the third minute, the 108 second light will be ahead by 60 seconds. At the fourth minute, the 108 second light will be ahead by 72 seconds. This is an increasing pattern which will be the largest when the traffic lights are 1 hour 48 minutes (1080 seconds) ahead of each other.

She can buy either 18 or 19 packs of pens, because the next pack of pens would give her either 20 pens or 21 pens. The correct answer is therefore either 18 or 19.\nNote that the correct answer could also be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14.\nHowever, if Martha buys 18 packs of pens, she will buy the same number of pencils as pens (18). This is not a very likely choice.\nOn the other hand, if Martha buys 19 packs of pens, she will buy two more pencils than pens (18 pencils and 17 pens), which is not consistent with the information that she wants to buy the same number of pencils as pens.\nIn other words, it is unlikely that Martha will buy either 18 or 19 packs of pens, so the correct answer is not 18.\nThe possible answer is 18, and therefore the probability of it being correct is 80%.\n```"}

In this new problem, there are 14 problems given and each person receives 5 points, which is still not necessarily 2. The 14 problem has a solution path of 14 - (11 + 3) = 0, and the 10 balloon problem has a solution path of 10 - (8 + 2) = 0.\nThe above question is not difficult at all, and the above problem was a straightforward transformation of this question into an unfamiliar problem. However, most of the participants were not able to find the solution path that could directly solve the problem. This transformation was done using the basic logical skills of addition and subtraction, which is why we were able to find that 80% of the participants failed this question.\n### Reference:\n[1] The following problem and its variants are collected from the Logical Reasoning Test of the Graduate Admission Program at the Massachusetts Institute of"}

{"question": "Bianca had 45 coloring books.

The second variable is giving 6 coloring books away. We can use the equation a - b = x as a way of reasoning this problem and get 45 - 6 = 39 coloring books. We can then use the equation a + b + c = x, which is similar to a - b = x, to reason out this problem. By substituting 39 into the second equation, we get 39 + 6 + c = x. This can be re-written as 45 + c = x. Therefore, Bianca now has a total of 45 + 20 = 65 coloring books.```\n\nA student that has not understood the critical step of reasoning out this problem will have a lot of trouble getting to this point, as the two equations mentioned above are not simple algebraic equations that they may be used to."}

So, we have a set of bumper car riders that can be represented by a set of ten numbers.  The two who left leave holes in the number line, like this:\n\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nAfter the two riders get in the line, we have the same situation, like this:\n\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nThe first two numbers are occupied with the two riders who left, so if we have to count them, we are double counting.
