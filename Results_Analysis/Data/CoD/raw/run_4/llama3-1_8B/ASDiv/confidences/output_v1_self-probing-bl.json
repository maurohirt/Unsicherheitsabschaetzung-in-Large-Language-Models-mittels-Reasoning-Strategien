How many pieces of candy did Mrs. Hilt give away?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "18", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nSolution:\nWe need to find the total number of pieces of candy given to all students in the group. In order to find the total number of pieces of candy, we will have to multiply the number of candies given to each student with the number of students in the group. For example, if the number of candies given to each student is 2 and the number of students in the group is 4, then the total number of candies given to the students is $2 \\times 4 = 8$. In the same way, the total number of candies given to the students in the group is\n$$2 \\times 9 = 18.$$\nHence, the answer is 18, which has a confidence of 90% according to the question."}

How many students are left on the bus?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7 students", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation:\nWe use a multinomial probability model to answer this question.\nLet $X$ be the number of students left on the bus. Then, we have $P(X=7) = 1/2$ and the other two answers are $P(X=5) = 1/3$ and $P(X=10) = 1/6$. Now if we want to answer the question: How likely is the answer 7 students to be correct? This corresponds to: $P(X=7|X=5, X=10) = 2P(X=7)/[2P(X=7)+3P(X=10)] = 2/3$.\nIn general, it seems that we are always using an improper model to answer this type of questions because the probability is always zero for one of the three answers in this case. In this problem, we know that $P(X=10)$ is really a zero and we only need to use $P(X=5)$ and $P(X=7)$ to estimate the probability. \nHowever, to be a bit more complete, here we assume that $P(X=10)$ is a small number that is unknown.

There are 54 noodles left and William received 12 noodles, so the only possible answer that I can think of that fits these conditions is 66.\n\nQ: Why is your answer more likely to be correct than the previous answer?\nI believe that my answer is more likely to be correct because the previous answer, which is 84, cannot be correct. When 12 noodles are taken away from 66 noodles, 54 noodles would be left, which is the correct answer.

Therefore, the probability that the answer is 17 is:\n\n$6/17$\n\nWe know that the probability of an event is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the number of total possible outcomes. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is 6, and the number of total possible outcomes is 17. Therefore, the probability that the answer is 17 is:\n\n$6/17$\n\nWe can also use the proportion method to solve this problem.

{"question": "There are 3 spiders. How many spider legs are there?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation:\nWe assume we do not know the exact type of spider. There are two species of spiders: two-legged and four-legged. If we were asked the question, \"There are 3 spiders. How many spider legs are there?\", we can use the probability formula to solve it.\n\nIf we think a two-legged spider is more common, then the probability will be higher. However, we do not know the exact type of spider, so we assume the probability is the same for both two-legged and four-legged spiders. Let's name them p_2 and p_4.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the first spider being two-legged will be 1/2 * 2 = 1, the probability of the second spider being two-legged will be 1/2 * 2 = 1, and the probability of the third spider being two-legged will be 1/2 * 2 = 1. So the total probability of all three spiders being two-legged is p_2 = 3/2.\n\nThe probability of all three spiders being four-legged is p_4 = 3/2. This is the probability of all three spiders being four-legged. Now, the probability of one spider being two-legged and two spiders being four"}

How many species was Penny able to identify?", "correct answer": 55.0, "llm answer": "55", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nQ: Do you agree or disagree with Penny's method? Please support your answer with evidence and arguments.\nDisagree. It's a bad idea to use the species that can be found in the ocean as a sample space, because there are too many sharks and whales, and there is a possibility that there is only one shark and whale in the whole ocean. We can simply say that Penny found sharks and whales are all different species. \n\nQ: What should Penny have done to make her sampling better? Please show your reasoning concisely.\nShe should pick a random species from sharks, eels, and whales in the ocean as a sample space. And then identify the species that were found in her trip.\n\nQ: Does the following sentence make sense? Please show your reasoning and explain why or why not.\n\"Probability of the event that the number of species Penny can identify is larger than 50, is 20%\". \nYes.

Show your reasoning and then answer with the following format:\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 49 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 0%\n\n\nSolution\n\nSolution: We can represent the two sets with sets of numbers. The number of wrappers Andy collected is 34. He may have wrapped his own sandwiches in tin foil, which we'll say were 3 wrappers. The number of wrappers Max collected is 15. We'll say that Max collected all the tin foil wrappers from his own family, which we'll say were 5 wrappers. 34-3=31 and 15-5=10. We know Andy had more wrappers than Max, so we can subtract the smaller set from the larger set and add it to get the total number of wrappers, which we'll say is 41. We know this number is incorrect, but we can start with 41 to find the total number of wrappers. Let's say we take the square root of 41, which is approximately 6.5. Then, we can multiply 6.5 by 2,"}

If the number of students sitting on the right and left side are the same, the total number of students on the bus would be 27 plus 27, or 54 students.

In the above situation, we can write down the number of shirts and trousers as follows:\n```\nNo. of shirts + No. of trousers\n589 + 345\n```\nIn the above situation, we can use ``+`` to combine numbers with same units. In the above situation, both numbers have the same unit: the number of pieces of clothing. Thus, we can write down the number of pieces of clothing he gave out in total as follows:\n```\nNo. of shirts + No. of trousers\n589 + 345 = 934\n```\nTherefore, Mr. Anderson gave out a total of 934 pieces of clothing."}

If not, why?\n```(46*0.7)^2```\n\nSolution:\n```Let's call n the number of the medieval art pieces left with her. We know that initially, Alicia has 70 pieces of medieval art, and then she donates 46 pieces, therefore, the total number of pieces is now 24. We need to calculate the probability that after donating 46 art pieces from the initial 70, the number of pieces left with Alicia (24) is 24. This is equal to the probability that 46 are donated out of the 70 pieces and 24 are left. We know that probability of 46 to be donated and 24 left is P(46 and 24) = P(46) * P(24). P(24) is simply the probability of getting 24 after we have 70, since we don't know the initial amount. P(24) = 24/70. We know that the amount of donated pieces is simply 70 minus the amount of pieces left with Alicia, which is 70 - 24 = 46. We know that we have 46 from the initial amount of 70, therefore,"}

Since it is the semi-finals and Chuck's team won, the Black Team must have scored more points than Chuck's team. Therefore, we know that the Black Team's score must be greater than 101\n* This is not a typical subtraction problem because the score could go up or down by any value from 1 to 49. For example, the score could go down by 1 point, so the answer could be 99, or it could go down by 48 points and the answer could be 53. There are many values that are more likely than 106 because it is very unlikely that the score would go down by 14 or more points. For instance, the odds of the score being 99 is 1/49 (99+1 to 49) and the odds of it being 53 is 1/49 (53-1 to 49). Thus, this answer cannot be the most likely. It is also possible that the score increased in any manner between 1 and 49, including 0. For instance, the score could have gone up by 1 point, so"}

Now we know that he saved $136 off the original price, which is 31% of the original price. So, we set up the equation $136 = $467*$0.31. We can solve for $467 by dividing both sides by $0.31 and get $467 = $441.94. His discount would be $467-$441.94 = $25.06. Finally, we subtract this value from $68, which gives $68-$25.06 = $42.94.

We will enumerate all the possibilities of bus number and supervisor number to compute the probability. In order to save the space, we will use a shorter format like 7*4, which means the total number of bus is 7 and the total number of supervisor is 4. Then we will sort the result and count how many time 28 is appeared. In this question, the number of possibilities is 49, but for the purpose of space, we can calculate like this. First of all, the number of possible buses is from 1 to 7. Therefore, the number of possibilities is 7. For each bus number, the number of supervisor can vary from 0 to 7 (total number of children in the trip), therefore, the number of possibilities for each bus number is 8. The total number of possibilities will be the multiplication of all the possible number for each bus number, which will be 7 * 8 = 49.\n\nThen we enumerate all the possibilities and check if the answer is 28, like this:\n|Total # of Bus | Total # of Supervisor | # of Supervisor - # of Bus | Correct? | |\n"}

{"question": "Jack loves to collect and read books. In fact, he has a mini-library in their house and he usually spends most of his time in it. The library is divided into different sections for different type of books. The science fiction section has 8 books. If each book has 478 pages,. how many pages do all the 8 books have in total?", "correct answer": 3824.0, "llm answer": "3824", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nSOLVED:\n\nI know this is too late to answer. But I will still do it because I am interested in the solution too.\n\nFirstly, I think the answer of 3824 is incorrect and the answer should be 3812. I calculated it by multiplying each number 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and added the numbers up. For example, 9 is multiplied with 1 which means 9 pages, and 8 is multiplied with 2 which means 8 x 2 = 16 pages and so on. Then, I added all of the pages up and got 3812. I think this is the right answer. I could be wrong but the probability that the book has 3824 pages is about 2% (I will explain why in a second).\n\nThe question only states that each book has 478 pages. Therefore, the probability of the book having 482 pages is also 1%. The probability of 482 pages, 484 pages, and 486 pages, as well as the probability"}

However, the problem asks us to find the total number of pages Jack will need to go through if he plans to read all the booklets, which means he has to read all 441 pages in the section and then go through the 6-page section with just the book covers, so the total number of pages Jack will need to go through is 441+6=447. However, the book covers are just extra filler to take up the extra pages, so the number of pages that are actually relevant to the book is 441 pages, so we could say that the 6 pages of the book covers count as 0 pages and there are actually 441 relevant pages in the section. If we wanted to be more specific, we could say that the total number of pages Jack will need to go through if he plans to read all the booklets is 447, but the number of pages that are actually relevant to the book is 441.\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

How many star-shaped stones will there be in each of the bracelet Betty makes for Brenda?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nA: To answer this question, one has to remember the meaning of \"likely\" as well as the fact that there can be multiple correct answers. Brenda, Betty's sister, wanted to have 3 bracelets with star-shaped stones. She also bought 36 star-shaped stones from the local store and gave it to Betty. How many star-shaped stones will there be in each of the bracelet Betty makes for Brenda? We are given the information that Brenda bought 3 bracelets and 36 star-shaped stones. If there are 36 star-shaped stones and Betty has to make 3 bracelets, that means each bracelet will have 12 stones. If we use the formula 12n + (n - 1) we get 36 which is correct. This means there can be 36 stones in each bracelet. It is likely that one answer is correct and that's why we give 100% confidence. But it is also likely that multiple answers are correct, so we give a 99% confidence.\nA:\nB:\nC:\nD:"}

But I think the question might be more complicated than that, as it could be asking how many people can be in the ferris wheel in total, in which case the answer would be 84+14. My reasoning is that, if you are not asking for the people on the seats, but the people in the ferris wheel in total, then the answer is not just 14x6, but 6x14, as each of the seats has 6 people on it, and there are 14 seats.\n\nQ: Did you calculate the answer by yourself?

The latter condition is also not hard to check, but it involves checking more than one pair of consecutive frogs.\n```The following is a possible explanation of why we should only include the numerical number when answering this question:\nThe question asks for the probability of the above answer to be correct, not the one you think correct. If we want to answer the question correctly, we need to give a numerical value to express the probability. However, the numerical value of this probability is not necessarily unique because there may be more than one correct answers. So, we need to include the numerical number to express the probability, but we cannot say that one of them is correct. The best we can do is to give a range of the possible numerical values.```\nIn this question, the probability of the above answer to be correct is 25%.\nNote that this explanation is not very rigorous.

How many feet long was the bookcase?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "5 feet", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n```Explanation: I assume 12 is considered one unit because 48 is divisible by 12. So it's just a straight forward translation from one unit to another. Since 12 is a unit, we need to convert 48 to 12 by dividing 48 by 12. The result would be 4 which would be a unit. One unit is equal to 1 foot. Thus 4 units is equal to 4 feet. Since there are 12 units in a bookcase, there are 4 feet in a bookcase. If you don't understand, consider one unit is equal to one unit. In order to convert unit to unit, you have to do the same operation for both sides. So if you are converting 48 inches to 12 inches, you would have to do the same for 12 feet and 1 feet. The result should be 4 feet.```"}

On the first day she saw 144 bees, so on the second day she saw 432 bees. It's a linear function, I just know.\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure, but i would guess 432, just seems logical.\n\nA: Assuming the pattern is that she sees 144 bees each day, then it would be 144*2=288 bees on the 2nd day. That would be the most likely answer. The next most likely answer would be 288 bees. Next would be 432.\n\nA: The answer is 432. I say this because if there were 144 bees on the first day and 3 times the amount the next day then 432 bees would be there. The other answer seems to have a 1 in front of the numbers and I am unsure of what that means.\n\nA: There are 144 bees the first day, so there must be"}

My first impulse was 30 (not quite correct) but after further reading and thinking the answer is 36. The answer is given by calculating the number of fleas that were alive yesterday (in his ears) minus the number of fleas that were alive today (in his ears). If you want to think about it mathematically, then it is the same as $36-85=−49$, which is the same as $36-85-0=−49$, because $−49−0=−49$.\n\nNow that we know the correct answer is 36, here is my reasoning for the confidence level.\nWe know that Harry had fleas yesterday, so we know that the probability of the above answer being correct is 1. Then if Harry has fleas today, then the probability of the above answer being correct is 0. And if Harry does not have fleas today, then the probability of the above answer being correct is 0.\nWe do not know if Harry has fleas today, so we can say the probability of the above answer being correct is 0.5."}

Thus, she needs 26 - 19 = 7 more cartons of berries.\nHowever, it is also possible for this question to be answered using logic. There are 26 cartons of berries in the berry cobbler, but Anita has 10 cartons of strawberries and 9 cartons of blueberries, for a total of 19 cartons. Thus, she needs 26 - 19 = 7 more cartons of berries to make the berry cobbler.\nIn either case, the answer is 7.\n\n"}

Rounding to 104, I subtracted that from 935 to get 831. I added 104 to that, since 4 classrooms remain, to get 935. I then subtracted the 104 classrooms donated pencils from the 935 total pencils donated to get 831 remaining pencils donated. Finally, I subtracted the 831 remaining donated pencils from the total remaining 935 donated pencils to get 104 donated pencils. I then multiplied the 104 donated pencils by 8, the number of remaining classrooms (8 is the remainder of 9 divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9), to get 832. Subtracting 832 from 831 yields 854.

Let’s say a sales tax rate is 6% and a product costs $100. To calculate the total cost including sales tax, multiply the product cost by the sales tax rate (0.06) and add the result to the product cost. ($100 × 0.06) + $100 = $106, so the total cost including sales tax is $106.00.\n\nLet’s now solve the problem given above:\n\nWe are told that Mrs. Hilt bought 15 boxes of citrus fruits for $12 each. Since she paid $12 for each box, then the total price is 15 x 12 = 180.\n\nWe also know that there was 6% sales tax added to the total cost. To find the sales tax, multiply the total cost by 6% and then divide the result by 100. 180 x 0.06 / 100 = 10.8. Add the sales tax to the total cost, 180 + 10.8 = 190.8.

How many pairs of shoes did the shop sell?", "correct answer": 83.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation:\n\nAs there are 96 shoes in total, this implies that 33% of the shoes are large-size, 52% are medium-size and 15% are small-size. If all shoes had the same chance of being sold, the shop should sell 48% of the shoes, which is $\\left(\\frac{2}{5} \\times 96\\right)$, giving an answer of 38 pairs. It is reasonable to suppose that large-size shoes are more likely to be sold. We will therefore assume that large-size shoes have a 40% chance of being sold and that medium-size shoes have a 50% chance of being sold. With this information we can work out that small-size shoes have a $\\left(1-\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ chance of being sold, i.e. 25%. If we then work out the expected number of small-size shoes sold $\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 24\\right)$ we see that the shop should sell 6 small-size shoes. In total, the shop should sell 16 + 26 + 6 = 48 shoes. Hence the shop should sell 48 − 13 = "}

Here's what I have in mind:\n\nThe question tells you that there are three groups of campers, soccer, basketball, and football. If there were 88 campers, then there must be at least one camper in each group. If we let S, B, and F stand for the number of soccer, basketball, and football campers, respectively, then we have S + B + F = 88. This is called an *equation* in one unknown, because we have only one variable, and that is S, B, and F. \n\nThere are two other equations that we can write. One is that the total number of soccer campers is B + F, so that B + F = 32, which is one equation in two unknowns. And the other is S + B = 24, so that S + B = 24 is another equation in two unknowns.\n\nNow, we can look at these two equations and see that we have 24, 32, and 88.

How many strawberries did each girl get?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6.6 strawberries", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: In the first step I'll simplify the problem: 53 strawberries were given to 8 people. Each got how many strawberries? So I can set up a division problem: 53 ÷ 8 = 6 with a remainder of 5. The remainder means that 5 strawberries were left over. That means that each person got 6 strawberries, but there are only 5 left over for the next person. So I'm going to subtract 6 from the total: 53 - 6 = 47. There are 47 strawberries left over. Now I can divide 47 by 8 to see how many strawberries each person will get: 47 ÷ 8 = 5 with a remainder of 7. This means that each person will get 5 strawberries, with 7 left over. So, if 47 strawberries are given to 8 people, each person will get 5 strawberries, with 7 left over. Now to find out how many strawberries each person would get if there were 53 strawberries, I'll add 6 strawberries to the 5 strawberries, to see how many strawberries each person will get: 5 + 6 = 11.

This is exactly a random variable with a uniform distribution in the interval (0, 1050). Let's denote this random variable by R. We want to know the distribution of the number of cups until the total volume of tea poured is 65ml (R_i = 65ml). If R_i is a positive integer, we will always be able to pour 65ml of tea into a cup since 65ml is smaller than 1050ml. Thus, the distribution of the number of cups until 65ml of tea is poured will be a truncated uniform distribution in the interval (0, 17). So, the answer is 16 cups."}

How many people will be at Dora's party?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "44", "confidence": 0.008, "probing response": "0.8%\nExplanation:\n```There were 16 kids who cannot attend the party. If they could, there will be 64 kids. So 64-16=48 kids would come. 48 is a multiple of 8 and 36 is a multiple of 9. The most possible number of sandwiches would be a multiple of 9 (the number of sandwiches) and a multiple of 8 (the number of kids who would come if they could). 36 is the smallest multiple of 9 and 8. So, there will be 36 sandwiches.```\n"}

But Kathleen can also use different combination of brochures and pamphlets. The question asks to \"without having any materials left over\", which means the numbers of pamphlets and brochures for each office must be the same. That's the reason why we need to add pamphlets or brochures to 12 or 18. After adding the same number of brochures or pamphlets, the number of pamphlets or brochures should be divisible by the number of offices. Otherwise, we will have leftovers. Since both pamphlets and brochures should be divisible by the number of offices, we only need to check which of 18 and 12 is divisible by the number of offices.\n\nQ: 6 brochures can be divided into each of 6 offices. But 18 brochures cannot be divided into 6 offices. So"}

The first sentence says that they had 95 games on the shelf, therefore the total number of games they had before the new batch arrived was 95, which means that the number of games that were sold plus the number of games that were on the shelf before the new batch of games was sold was 95. The second sentence says that 68 games were sold the first week. Therefore, the number of games that were on the shelf plus the number of games that were sold the first week was 95.\nTherefore, 27+68=95.\nTherefore, we should choose the answer as 27.\nThe correct answer is: 27"}

(Please note that 100% score will be given to the correct solution even if it is not presented as a paragraph.)\nThe question has nothing to do with probability. It can be solved by simple arithmetic. First, we notice that the 35 campers went rowing in the morning does not tell us the exact number of campers, but we can say that there are no more than 35 campers, since all the campers went rowing in the morning. The afternoon group consists of 27 campers, and there are no more than 35 campers in the group. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no more than 57 campers. Now, if there are 28 campers in the afternoon group, it is possible that 35 campers went rowing in the morning, as the question does not specify the exact number of campers. However, if there are 29 campers in the afternoon group, it is not possible that 35 campers went rowing in the morning"}

Since there are 12 nickels and 12 quarters, each quarter is equal to $0.25 * 12 = $3. Hence, one coin has $0.25 * 12 = $0.30.\n\nSecondly, how many coins do we have? Since each coin has $0.30, $12 in nickels and quarters should have $0.30 * 40 = $12.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will list all the possible options.

{"question": "Thomas made 8700 mL of tomato soup. He packed 1.6 L of the soup in his kids' lunches. He then froze half of the remaining soup. How many milliliters of soup did Thomas freeze?", "correct answer": 3550.0, "llm answer": "4300 mL", "confidence": 0.009000000000000001, "probing response": "0.90%\n\nExplanation: In this problem, you can assume that the quantity of tomato soup that Thomas packs for his kids' lunches is a random sample of the total quantity of soup he made. That is, Thomas might be more likely to pack the soups that his kids like better in their lunches, but this is unlikely to change the average amount of soup in each lunch box. This problem is concerned with averages, and thus is a question of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The average lunch volume is $\\overline{X} = \\frac{1600}{8700} = \\frac{8}{45}$ and the standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{8700} * (8700 - 8)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8700 - 8}{8700}}$. The question asks for the probability that the soup that Thomas froze is 4300 mL or greater. The random variable here is the volume of soup that Thomas froze. It is approximately normally distributed, so the answer is 0.900."}

He filled half of the remaining space with grape juice. So, 1/4 of the punch bowl was filled with grape juice. Finally, he filled the rest of the punch bowl with cherry juice. Therefore, the amount of cherry juice that is filled is 3/4 times the volume of the punch bowl, and the volume of the punch bowl is equal to 1/4 of the total volume of the juices plus 3/4 of the total volume of the juices. So, the total volume of the juices is equal to 4/7 times the volume of the punch bowl. We have 1/2 L orange juice, 1/4 L grape juice, and 300 mL cherry juice. So, the total volume of the juices is equal to 1/2 L+1/4 L+300 mL. If we substitute 1/2 L+1/4 L+300 mL for 4/7 of the volume of the punch bowl, we can find that the volume of the punch bowl is equal to 7/4 L. Therefore, Wes made 81.25 L of fruit punch."}

The question is silent on this, but if there is no context, then we must assume that this happens an infinite number of times, i.e., there is no stopping point. In such a case, this would be an infinite geometric series. You would be justified in using the formula for geometric series for this question.\n\nFor geometric series, we multiply the terms in a geometric series. That would be 3 x 4 x 3 x 4... And that would be 3 x 4 = 12 x 3 x 4 = 48 x 3 x 4 = 144 x 3 x 4... In each case, the previous product would be multiplied by 12. Since each term increases by 12, we can write the formula for geometric series as (3 x 4) / (1-12) = (3 x 4) /"}

The first step to solve this question is to understand the formula.  The formula says if two numbers are in a ratio a : b, then the first number is a/b multiplied by their sum. That is, x = a/b * (a + b) where x is the first number and y = (a + b) - x is the second number.  That is why the answer will be 44 * 3/11 - 44 * 8/11 = 32 - 12.\nThere are two possible interpretations of the question. If it asks what is the difference between the two numbers that satisfy the criteria given, then 32 - 12 is correct. If it asks what is the difference between the two numbers that are asked in the question, then the difference is 0. To differentiate the two questions, we could interpret the question as: Find two numbers in ratio 3:8 with a sum of 44 and compute the difference between them."}

What is the length of the longer piece?\n\nFirst, we determine what Terry's ratio means.  It means that Terry is cutting the rope into a piece that is 3 times longer as the other one.  This ratio would have the same meaning if Terry cut it into 4 equal pieces.  Then he would cut out 3 pieces and leave one.\n\nSecond, Terry is going to use the ratio to figure out what fraction each piece is.  Terry knows that the whole rope is 35 inches long, so he can figure out how big each piece is.\n\nThird, Terry takes the total length of the rope and divide it by how many pieces he is going to cut it.  In this case, Terry will cut it into 2 pieces.\n\nFourth, to figure out the length of the longer piece, Terry takes 1 away from 2 because there will be one less piece to figure out.\n\nFifth, to figure out the length of the shorter piece, Terry takes the total length of the rope and divides it by 2.  Then he takes the number that he gets and subtracts 1 away from it.\n\nSixth"}

All we need is to know the difference between Audrey's and Paul's number of peaches. In general, there are three cases:\n- Audrey's number of peaches is larger than Paul's number of peaches, and thus the difference is positive.\n- Audrey's number of peaches is smaller than Paul's number of peaches, and thus the difference is positive.\n- Audrey's number of peaches is equal to Paul's number of peaches, and thus the difference is 0.\nSince the problem says that Audrey has 26 peaches and Paul has 48 peaches, the case is that Audrey has less peaches than Paul does and thus the difference is positive. Therefore, the possible answer could be the largest positive number, 48 - 26 = 22.\nSince the problem asks for the confidence, we just need to consider the probability of the possible answer.

In order to find the confidence interval, we need to find the minimum and maximum values that the sample mean is likely to fall into, so that the confidence percentage would apply to it. For example, for a 95% confidence level, a 95% confidence interval would be a range in which the population mean is most likely to fall into. \nIn order to find the confidence interval for Ted's and Fred's height, we need to determine the sample mean (x̄), and then multiply this value by 2. So if we determine that the sample mean is 58 inches, the confidence interval will be from 58 - 2* 58 = 116 inches to 58 + 2* 58 = 180 inches."}

You should also know that when two numbers add up to some number n, they can be any combination of pairs (1,n-1), (2,n-2), (3,n-3),... all the way down to (1,n). (0,n) is impossible and (n,0) would be trivial. Then you should know that when a number is some multiple of another, the larger number is some power of the smaller number. In this case, the larger number is 6 times the smaller number, so 6 must be a power of 6. You should also know that the only power of 6 that is less than 70 is 2^2, which is 36. So you should have concluded that the two numbers are 6 and 64, 15 and 55, 24 and 46, 33 and 37, or 42 and 28.\n\nQ: How likely is your answer to be correct?\nA: I did it as follows: The smaller number is "}

Now they are `1/y` and `3/y` after we add `2` to each of the numbers, then `1/x+2` and `3/x+2` will be `1/y+2` and `3/y+2`.\nHence `(1/x+2) / (3/x+2) = 1/y+2 / 3/y+2`. By dividing the both sides of equation by `1` we get `(x+2) / (3x+2) = (y+2) / (3y+2)`.\nWe know that the equation `(x+2) / (3x+2) = (y+2) / (3y+2)` is also equal to `1/(1+x/3x+2) = 1/(1+y/3y+2)`, and hence `1+x/3x+2 = 1+y/3y+2`.\nNow we have to find a solution of `1+x/3x+2 = 1+y/3y+2` or `x/3x+2 = y/3y+"}

The problem is now reduced to the following:\n\nOne boy puts marbles in groups of 6 and the other puts them in groups of 9. If the total number of groups is 72, how many marbles does each boy have?\n\nThen there are 2 possible cases to be considered:\n\nCase 1: 6 | 9\nSince the boys are putting the marbles in groups of 6 and 9, respectively, if both boys are putting the marbles in the same number of groups, the boys must have equal number of marbles. Therefore, in case 1, both boys have 54 marbles. And the number of groups is 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nCase 2: 7 | 9\nIn case 2, the total number of groups is 72 = 7 + 9 + 56. Now "}

Suppose the two numbers are x, y, and the second number is x+10. Therefore, the sum is: x+y = 52. We can solve this algebraically by moving y to the other side, resulting x = 52-y. We now have y+y+10 = 52, we can substitute x and get 2y+10 = 52, we can subtract 10 on both sides and divide by 2, and we get y = 21 and then x = 31. The answer is x = 31, y = 21.\n\n2. Another way is by using a guessing approach: we can guess a number and then add 10, which should give us a number close to 52, or even 52. Let's start with 5, add 10 and we get 15, which is too high. Let's try 4, add 10 and we get 14, still too high. Let's try 3, add 10 and we get 13, still too high. Let's try 2, add 10 and we get 12, too low. Let's try"}

[Please only include the answer below this if the above answer is correct]\nWe know that the total time to cover a certain distance is equal to the total distance covered divided by the total speed. In this case, the total time to cover the distance is 15 hours and the total distance covered is 650 kilometers. To find the speed, we can use the formula speed = distance / time. Thus, the total speed is 650 / 15 = 43.3 kilometers per hour. Now, we know that the car travels 30 kilometers per hour uphill and 50 kilometers per hour downhill. Since the total speed is 43.3 kilometers per hour, we can find the time it took to travel uphill and downhill. To do this, we can use the formula time = distance / speed. For the uphill portion, the distance is 30 kilometers and the speed is 30 kilometers per hour, so the time is 30 / 30 = 1 hour. For the downhill portion, the distance is 20 kilometers and the speed is 50 kilometers per hour, so the time is 20 / 50 = 0.4 hours. Thus, the total time spent traveling uphill and"}

What is your reasoning and how can we be sure of it?\nThe sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. This is obvious from the fact that the three angles form a straight line. Another proof is based on similar triangles. When a pair of triangles are similar, the angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are proportional. If two of the angles are equal, then the triangles are similar. Since the third angle of a triangle is supplementary to the other two, it must be true that the angles of any triangle sum to 180 degrees.\n\nQ: A line segment that connects two nonadjacent vertices is called a diagonal.

Then in 45 minutes he can mow 45 * 60 * 60 = 162000 square meters. If Kevin can mow 1 square meter in 1 second then in 180 minutes (or 3 hours) he can mow 180 * 60 * 60 = 324000 square meters. So the question is how long does it take to mow a square law that is 30 meters * 30 meters. We know in 1 second he can mow 1 square meter. So in 324000 seconds he can mow 324000 square meters. Now 30 meters * 30 meters is the same as 30 * 30 = 900 square meters. So it will take him 324000 / 900 = 360 seconds to mow the lawn. And 360 seconds is 6 minutes. So we got the answer 180 minutes."}

{"question": "An experienced ice skater spins on the ice, creating a perfect circle. Afterwards, she calculates that it must have a circumference of 6.28 yards. What is the circle's diameter?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2 yards", "confidence": 0.15, "probing response": "15%\n\n\nSolution: Here's how I approached this problem. Note that I used $C = \\pi d$ as a formula to calculate circumference (where C is the circumference and d is the diameter), but I could also have used the more well-known formula $C = 2 \\pi r$ where r is the radius. If I had chosen the latter, I would have divided C by 2 and then multiplied by 2 again, which I think would have been an overcomplication of the problem (and probably a more roundabout way of solving the problem).\n\nI immediately went to a number line of integers to get a rough idea of the range of possible values for the diameter. 1 yard seems too small, 3 yards is the first number that is more than twice the previous number, and 4 yards is the first number that is more than 3 times the previous number, so I can confidently say that the diameter is less than 4 yards. After looking at the number line, I decided that 2 yards is probably the correct answer. Here's why: 3 yards is probably too big to be correct because 3 is not a number that frequently comes up in real life. 3 is also not a prime number."}

The answer to the question is how many flowers would be in the last vase that isn't full.\nWe are asked for the last vase, so the last full vase before this is 139 vases.\nSo we just need to see what the remainder of the division of 9 hundred five divided by 139 is.\nThis remainder is three flowers, so 3 flowers left.\nThis is how to solve the problem:\nWe can divide 9 hundred five by 139 and check how many are left over (remainder).\nWe can also divide 9 hundred five by 7 to find how many times 7 fits into 9 hundred five, and multiply that by 7, which leaves us the remainder.\nIf we divide 9 hundred five by 7, we get 1 hundred three and 2/7.\nIf we multiply 1 hundred three by 7, we get 9 hundred 21.\nIf we subtract 9 hundred 21 from 9 hundred five, we get three.\nSo, 3 flowers are left, and this is our answer."}

(See note.) That's because the total divided by the part is the inverse of the part divided by the total, which is always a ratio of less than 1. In this case, dividing the 52 books by the 24 fiction books tells us that there are 2.17 books of other types for every 1 fiction book. That's a ratio of 2.17 to 1. The ratio we're looking for is the other way around: the ratio of fiction to other books, which is just the inverse ratio, or 1 to 2.17.

If the house has 7 rooms,. how many outlets does he need total?", "correct answer": 42.0, "llm answer": "42", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nExplanation: This is a classic problem of combinatorics, counting the number of ways to choose r objects from a population of n objects. This is also called the Combination. The formula for this is C(n,r) = n! / r!(n - r)!, where n! means the factorial function n * (n-1) * (n-2) *.... * 3 * 2 * 1. For example, 7! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040. Using this formula, we get that C(7,6) = 7! / 6!(7-6)! = 7! / 6! * 1! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 / (6*5*4*3*2*1 * 1) = 7. Therefore, the contractor needs a total of 7 rooms x 6 outlets per room = 42 outlets. The reasoning above may seem complicated, but it's easy once you get used to it. It's a common question that comes up in combinatorics, and there's no need to be nervous."}

Then,\n`x - 2` is the number of posters they have left.\n\nThat is to say, the total number of posters they had is `x` and the number of posters they have left is `x - 2`.\n\nTherefore, the number of posters they had is `x - 2`.\n\nBut the book fair sold four posters.

So we can assume the repetitions are uniformly distributed.\n- If we assume repetition is uniformly distributed, the chance of it being in the next category to the one that it is currently in is 1 in 8.\n- Therefore, the chance of repetition being 13 is 1/8 * 1/8 * 86 = 0.0002\n- Therefore, the probability of it being 13 is 0.2%\n- Since 1-0.2%= 0.8\n- Thus the probability of answer 13 to be correct is 80%```\n\nQ: How many days can we survive without drinking water?

But I think the question wants us to pick answer 2. If you put answer 2, which is \"Gwen sold 2 books\", you are implying that Gwen didn't bring any books. If you put answer 3, which is \"Gwen did not sell any books\", you are implying that Gwen brought more than 96 books. Both implications are wrong.\n\nThe first sentence says: \"After the activity ended she had ninety-six books left\" and then \"How many did she sell?\" So if she had 96 books left, she must have sold 2 books.\n\nI agree that the word \"not\" should be added in front of \"sold any books\".\n\nAfter the activity ended she had ninety-six books left.

If the question asks for her number of cloves of garlic used, the answer would be 86.\nSince 93 is a little bit larger than 90, 93 minus 86 should be a little bit larger than 90 minus 86, and 7 is smaller than 7.\nSince 93 is a multiple of 3 and 7 is not, 7 cannot be a multiple of 3. Therefore, 93 minus 86 cannot be a multiple of 3. 7 is not a multiple of 3.\n7 is a prime number. Since 93 is a multiple of 3, it cannot be a multiple of 7.

In this case the mean should have been the sum of the numbers in each day divided by 6 instead of 5. Since the denominator is 5, the mean is shifted towards the number in the last day, making it much more likely to have an error.\n\n(2) It is highly possible that there is a typo in the answer. Cody is unlikely to make this type of arithmetic mistake.\n\n(3) Cody did not explicitly mention any rule that the numbers should be evenly distributed between different days, so there could be some bias from that.\n\n(4) Cody is not particularly good at math.

The idea is that you have to choose the number of groups you can divide the materials into, and there are 36 ways to choose them. Since you want to minimize the number of groups, you are choosing the greatest number possible. So the largest number of classrooms is $$ \\frac{36}{20} = 1.8 $$\n\nSo I have to disagree with Joanne. The most accurate answer would be to choose an integer, and the greatest integer less than 1.8 is 1. Therefore the answer is 1.\n\nThe only way to make this a good answer is to ask the question as: \"What is the greatest number of classrooms Joanne can distribute materials to such that there are no flyers or buttons left over?\" It is then obvious that she cannot do so, because the largest number of students with a number of flyers (or buttons) that is divisible by 20 is 20.

In each arrangement he wants to use the same number of roses and daisies. We can let the number of roses be $$x$$. Then we would also use $$x$$ daisies to make each arrangement. The greatest possible number of arrangements is $$7/x$$. We can find this by dividing the number of roses by $$x$$. If $$x$$ is equal to the number of roses, we would divide 7 by 7 and get 1. If $$x$$ is less than the number of roses, we would get a number less than 1. We can't have a fraction of an arrangement, so $$x$$ has to be 7. There is only one arrangement that Ariel can make."}

The reasoning for this is that if the $100$ caller is receiving a $100$ bill then the $10$ caller will receive a free concert ticket, and $10$ is $100$% of $10$ which equals $1$. If it were $3000$ callers then the $300$ callers will receive both and $300$ is $30$% of $1000$. In short, this reasoning allows us to solve the problem in $10$ calls since there is a total of $100$% of $100$ tickets that will be given out, and each person receives a ticket every $100$ calls. Therefore, every $10$ calls a person receives both a ticket and a $100$ bill.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe answer should be 10 since every 100 callers receives the 100 bill, 10 calls will receive both, the 100 bill and the free concert tickets.

It does not matter how big or small we make our picture; it is just a representation of the situation in the problem. I made it small just because this page is small.\n\nWe will be using the variable L to stand for the length of the circular track. The only thing we are given about the length of the track is the statement that it is circular. So we can say L is any positive number. However, there is another constraint we can determine from the picture and the statements in the problem. The distance Henry travels around the circular track in 7 minutes must be the same as the distance Margo travels around the track in 12 minutes. So, we can write an equation:\n\n$$L\\times\\frac{7\\min}{1\\min} = L"}

I won’t show the reasoning.\n\nThe answer is 11.\n\nIn the following, I will show the reasoning. To answer the question, we need to find the largest common divisor of 36 and 44. The way to find the largest common divisor of two numbers $n_1$ and $n_2$ is to find the greatest divisor of $n_1$ that divides $n_2$. In other words, we find the greatest $d$ such that $d|n_1$ and $d|n_2$.\n\nWe first look at the divisors of $n_1$:\n$1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36$.\n\nNow, we look at the divisors of $n_2$:\n$1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44$.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor of 36 and 44 is 4.\n\nIn fact, for $n_1$ and $n_2$, the greatest common divisor is also the smallest positive number of the form $n_1x +"}

So, if we know the maximum number of sandwiches that can be made with one of each of the turkey, cheese, and tomato slices, we would know the maximum number of sandwiches that can be made. \n\nIn order to find the maximum number of sandwiches, we can find how many groups of three sandwiches there are that contain at least one of each type of filling.

The first part was to write an equivalent expression of $\\sqrt{x+2} = 5$ in the form $ax + b$ using the quadratic formula. The second part was to then find the slope of the tangent line at the point $(\\frac{13}{4}, \\frac{1}{2})$ of the curve $y = \\sqrt{x+2}$. The final part is to find the equation of the tangent line in the form $y = mx + b$.\nSolution: To solve this problem we will use the quadratic formula which gives us: $\\sqrt{x+2} = 5 \\sqrt{x+2} - 4$. From this we can see that the only possible value for $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. So we have: $y = \\sqrt{x+2}$ which simplifies to: $y = 5 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} + 2}$ or $y = 5 \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{2}}$.

Introduction\nOne of the most interesting problems in statistics is the following problem: how to measure the confidence of the human judgments. By human judgment, we refer to the numerical number (or a numerical range) given by a human being in response to a question in the format “How likely is X to be correct?”, where X is a statement, an answer, or a hypothesis (e.g. “X” can be the answer 92 to the above question). Such type of question is commonly used in surveys to measure the satisfaction or the likeliness of consumers or users.\nTo address this problem, we propose a new model, called “confident model”, and design a new data structure, called “confidence interval”, to measure the confidence level of human judgments and to compare them with each other. Given a data set of judgments, the proposed model and data structure can automatically find out the correct answer to the question, with a confidence level that depends on the size of the data set.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section  2\ndescribes related work. Section  3\ngives an overview of our proposed model and data structure. The detailed model definition is presented in"}
