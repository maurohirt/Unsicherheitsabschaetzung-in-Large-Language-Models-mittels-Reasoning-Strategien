Well, that's a great question. What we're given is this, and we're told that that's a red apple, and we're told that that's a green apple, and there are a total of seven red apples. So how many apples in all? Well, we have two green apples, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So the answer would be nine. There are nine apples, two green and seven red. This is a fairly easy one. Um, so for this particular question, let's call confidence 100. Um, it is the easiest question. We don't have to really think much about it.\n\nUniversity of Washington - Seattle Campus\n##### Alice G.\nUniversity of Michigan - Ann Arbor\n\n##### Christina K.\nUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison\n##### Andy C.\nUniversity of Michigan - Ann Arbor\n##### Matt O.\nLewis University\n##### Megh"}

{"question": "Sandra took six cups of coffee and Marcie took two cups of coffee. How many cups of coffee did Sandra and Marcie take in total?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.907, "probing response": "90.7%\nExplanation: This question requires adding two integers. First, it requires us to determine whether Sandra and Marcie took the coffee at the same or different time, and then add the coffee they took. Since Sandra takes six cups of coffee and Marcie takes two cups of coffee, they take coffee at the same time. The sum of 6 + 2 is 8, so they took 8 cups of coffee in total."}

How many beavers are still working on their home?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nReasoning: This is a logical reasoning problem. The question presents a scenario where two beavers are working on their home, and one of them decides to take a swim. The question then asks how many beavers are still working on their home.\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the keywords that provide additional information and use them to reason about the number of beavers still working on their home.\nThe given keywords are:\n* 'beavers' – A plural noun indicating that there are more than one beaver involved in the scenario.\n* 'working on their home' – A phrase that describes the current activity of the beavers, indicating that they are actively engaged in constructing or maintaining their home.\n* '1 went for a swim' – An action taken by one of the beavers, indicating that they are no longer participating in the construction or maintenance of their home.\nBy combining these keywords, we can deduce that there are only two beavers involved in the scenario – the one who went for a swim and the one who is still working on their home. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there is only one beaver still working on their home.\n"}

{"question": "There are 3 spiders. How many spider legs are there?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nReasoning:\n```First, assume that there are 8 legs per spider. Then, there are 8 \\\\* 3 legs in total. The total number of legs must be a multiple of 8 (8 is the number of legs per spider). 24 is not a multiple of 8, so we cannot accept this answer. \nSecond, we need to find another number for the total number of legs such that it is a multiple of 8. This means we need to multiply the number of spiders with a whole number. Since we already know that the total number of spiders is 3, 3 must be a whole number. Hence, the number we are multiplying the spiders by must be a whole number too. \nSo, let's try the following:\n\\\\(\\\\{3, 3, 3\\\\} \\\\times {1, 1, 1} = 9\\\\)\n\\\\(\\\\{3, 3, 3\\\\} \\\\times {1, 1, 2} = 12\\\\)\n\\\\(\\\\{3, 3, 3\\\\} \\\\times {1, 2, 2} = 21\\\\)\n\\\\(\\\\{3, 3,"}

My reasoning is as follows:\n\n1.  The phrase \"15 pieces of pepperoni, 10 pieces of salami, and 30 pieces of bacon\" suggests that we are dealing with a sum, rather than multiplication or division. This immediately eliminates any possibilities involving fractions or decimals, leaving us with the option of simply adding up the numbers mentioned.\n2.  A quick scan through the possible answers shows that only 55 matches our expected sum (15 + 10 + 30), thus making it the most likely candidate.\n3.  The question also states that Annie's friends are throwing her a surprise birthday party, implying that there may be some element of surprise involved. If I were writing this question, I would likely include an element of uncertainty to increase the difficulty level, such as having two or more possible sums within the correct range. This helps to create a more engaging puzzle that challenges the solver without being overly difficult.\n4.

His father placed 426 more hotdog sticks in the same brown bag. How many hotdog sticks did Dylan and his father place in the brown bag? \n\nSince there are two separate sets of hotdog sticks in this problem, we need to find the union of these two sets. We know that the union of two sets is the elements that are in at least one of the two sets. We also know that when we count, the order of the elements does not matter. This means that we can list the elements in the order that makes the calculation easier. In this case, we will list the elements in the order they were mentioned. Therefore, we will first count the elements from the first set and then count the elements from the second set. The first set has 241 elements, and the second set has 426 elements. This means that the union of these two sets has 241 + 426 = 667 elements. Therefore, the correct answer is 667."}

This reduces the number of possible answers to 6: $18, $24, $30, $42, $49, and $69. \n\nSince the keywords `have $50.00` and `buy some refreshments` imply that she spent more money than she had left, we can reduce the list of possibilities further to just the 3 highest numbers: $42, $49, and $69. \n\nSince the keywords `69` and `have $69` imply that she had $69 before buying refreshments, we can eliminate the $49 answer and only consider $42 and $69. \n\nFinally, the keywords `she bought some refreshments` implies that she spent more than just the amount of money she had left, which means that she must have spent the $42 instead of $69, giving us the answer of $91.\n```"}

Therefore, she must have spent less than $17.00 on the chips, making it clear that the answer could not be 35. We also know that the chips originally cost $35.00, so we know that the discount must have been a significant percentage. Therefore, it is unlikely that the discount was $17.00, and it is more likely that the answer is 18.

Since the paint was purchased to add to existing 36 gallons of paint, it can be assumed that 23 gallons are used up, and the 36 gallons are still there. So the amount of paint he needs is 70 - 36 - 23 = 11 gallons.\n2. \"For finishing touches\" suggests that only a small amount of paint is needed. This supports the previous interpretation of using up 23 gallons and leaving 36 gallons of existing paint.\n\nReasoning:\n1. \"70 gallons of paint\" represents the total amount of paint needed. 70 - 36 represents the remaining amount of paint needed. Since \"36 gallons of paint\" is given, it means that the remaining amount of paint needed is the difference between 70 and 36. 70 - 36 = 34.

It might seem to you the 9 minutes of time spent per exhibit might be the total time spent in the museum.

Therefore I think the possible answer of 63 minutes is not correct. I think the possible answer is 9 minutes. And I think the reason why the possible answer is 9 minutes is because the question is asking for time spent per exhibit and we see in the additional information that each exhibit takes 9 minutes to go through."}

To find the time it took Stanley to get to the top, we need to find 30 minutes times 7. Let's start by setting up an equation: \n30 minutes times 7 = x \nWe can then use the order of operations to solve the equation: \n(x)(7) = 30 minutes times 7 \n= x \nSince x is the unknown variable in our equation, we can solve for it by dividing both sides by 7: \n(x) / 7 = 30 minutes times 7 / 7 \n= x / 7 \n= 210 minutes \nTherefore, the correct answer is 210 minutes."}

The depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height, and he stands at 6 feet. The word 'and' shows these 2 pieces of information to be in conjunction. In addition, the keyword 'after resting' shows Dean's height to be unchanged. So Dean's height is 6 feet, and the depth of the water is 10 times of Dean's height. 10 times 6 = 60, so the answer is 60 feet.\n\nQ: Which of the following has the biggest negative effect on your confidence in answer 60 feet?\n\nPossible Answer: The water was not 10 times deeper than Dean's height.\n\nExplanation: First of all, Dean's height did not change after resting, and we can infer the water depth was 10 times of Dean's height. Secondly, because of the 'and', the water was definitely deeper than Dean's height, which we can infer from the answer 60 feet.

The possible reason for the high confidence level is that 320 is a large number and I know from experience that boat rides are expensive. I also know that Dean's friend Mark is a very wealthy person and so it is reasonable to assume that he has a lot of money to spend on boat rides.\nHowever, there are some potential reasons for doubt. Firstly, the question does not specifically say that Mark was travelling on a boat ride, it could have been any type of transportation. Secondly, the cost of boat rides varies depending on the location and the type of boat, so it is difficult to know exactly how much a boat ride for 40 miles would cost. Thirdly, it is not clear from the question whether Mark was travelling alone or with someone else, which would affect the cost. Fourthly, it is not clear from the question whether Mark had any other expenses during his trip, such as food or accommodation, which would also affect the cost. Finally, it is not clear from the question whether Mark actually went on a boat ride or not, so it is possible that the answer is incorrect. Overall, I think there is a moderate chance that the answer is correct."}

The word \"harvest\" means to pick fruits (apples) from trees. The word \"sack\" refers to a container which can hold many apples. The word \"daily\" indicates that the process of picking apples takes place every day.\nFrom the question, I know that there are 8 sections of the orchard, and each section produces 45 sacks of apples every day. If there are 8 sections, then there will be 45 x 8 = 360 apples that are picked every day.

This is the closest that we can get and this does not match the answer in the question. We can see by the given information that each species has 7 pairs of birds and with the given information that there are 29 endangered bird species on that region, this should match the answer given. Therefore, there are 7*29 pairs of birds. Therefore, there are 29*7=203 pairs of birds. The answer that fits the information and the given keywords is 203.```\n"}

The following is an excerpt from the article:\nTo understand the importance of grammatical rules, consider the following example:\n\"Yesterday, John walked into the room and sat in a chair. When he sat in a chair, he suddenly got a very strange feeling.\"\nThe sentence is ambiguous because one cannot tell whether John's strange feeling occurred before or after he sat in the chair.

That is, by adding the rule \"an action that is said to occur before a certain time (point) is said to occur before that time (point),\" the sentence is unambiguous. That is, John got a strange feeling before he sat in the chair.

If they were to give each boy 7 marbles, then they would have only 5 marbles left, which is not true.\nNow let's move on to the second reasoning. According to the answer 5 will get 7 marbles, it is very likely that 7 is the number of marbles that each boy will get. Therefore, each boy will get 35/7 = 5 marbles. Therefore, each boy gets 5 marbles. So the answer is very likely to be 5 will get 5 marbles.\nHowever, the given keywords also provide important information about Haley's class. According to the keywords, Haley's class has 5 boys who love to play marbles. This means that Haley's class is likely to have a number of students that is a multiple of 5.

{"question": "On the first Saturday of spring, Jane woke up early to enjoy the whole day and help with chores at home. Jane had been saving large empty cans to serve as pots for sunflowers. If she has 54 sunflower seeds and there are 9 cans,. how many seeds will be placed in each can if she places an equal number of seeds in each can?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n```Reasoning: \nWe know there are 54 seeds and 9 cans. Jane wants to put equal amount of seeds in each can. So, she will divide the total number of seeds by the number of cans.\nWe know division by a number will make a number smaller. Therefore, 54 will be smaller than 9. We need to see if 54 is divisible by 9. The biggest factor of 9 is 9. If we divide 54 by 9, we will have a remainder, so it's not divisible by 9.\nSo, the total number of seeds should be divisible by 9. This eliminates the possible answer of 5. If we divide 54 by 8, the number of seeds in each can will be 6.5, which isn't an integer, so we know that 54 is not divisible by 8.\nThe next possible answer is 7. 54 is not divisible by 7. 54 is not divisible by 6. 54 is divisible by 3 and 2. 54 is divisible by 2 and 3. Therefore, 54 ÷ 3 = 18 and 18 ÷ 2 = 9, so we know"}

To do this, he must divide the total number of stars by the number of cans. 34 / 4 = 8.5. This means that each can should receive 8.5 stars. To find the number of stars that will be left unpainted, we can subtract the number of stars that are already distributed from the total number of stars. 34 - 8.5 = 25.5, which is the correct answer.\n\nQ: How does the answer change, when the keywords are removed?\nConfidence: 5%\nJustification: When the keywords are removed, the answer becomes 25. This is because the original question asked how many stars will be left unpainted when Matt has 4 small cans of gold paint and the 34 stars that they made are distributed equally to the cans of paint. However, without the keywords, the question becomes unclear as to whether the 34 stars are already distributed among the 4 cans of paint or not.

She then shares this tea with her parents and three siblings. Let's let p, q, and r be the amount of tea shared with the parents and siblings, respectively. Since she has four people, we can equate our values to x and set up a system of equations:\n\nq + r + 2p = 10\nq + r + 2p = 4\n\nFrom this, we can determine that q + r = 6. Since there are only 10 cups, each of the four people only get one cup.\n\nQ: Which keyword is most important in supporting the above reasoning? Possible keywords: [teacups, Britney, tea, siblings, parents]\nKeywords: Britney brewed lemon tea that's enough to fill ten cups.\n\nExplanation: We were given that Britney brewed ten cups of tea.

The score for each option is computed by the classifier by first computing the confidence score (likelihood) for each keyword in the text and then the total score is the weighted sum of the individual keyword score. For example, for the answer option 20, the score for each keyword is computed as follows\n* keyword : 4 slices -> score : 0.5\n* keyword : 5 pizzas -> score : 0.0\n* keyword : 20 slices -> score : 1.0\n* keyword : 25 slices -> score : 0.5\n\nThe keyword \"4 slices\" and \"5 pizzas\" have a very low score since there are no exact keywords to match from the possible answer. The keywords \"20 slices\" and \"25 slices\" have a moderate score but \"20 slices\" has a slightly higher score. For computing the total score, we used weights of [0.2,0.1,0.3,0.4] respectively.

This type of problem could be written as\n```P(zoo) = P(T1 * T2 * T3) = (T1 * T2) * T3``` where the first term, T1, is the number of children tickets and the second term, T2, is the number of adults tickets and the third term, T3, is the cost of each ticket. The first term has the multiplicative property of combining the two separate tickets, while the second term uses the additive property of combining the two separate costs. To solve the problem, we have to decide on the multiplicative value of T1 and T2 and the additive value of T3. We then have to apply those values to the formula and calculate the resulting total cost of the zoo tickets. The provided answer uses the multiplicative property to determine the cost of the adult tickets and the additive property to determine the cost of the child tickets.

Thus, the total number of leaves broken and lost is 43+24=67. \nIn order to find out how many leaves are left in Ryan's collection, we can subtract the total number of leaves broken and lost from the total number of leaves. So, 89-67=22. This means Ryan has 22 leaves left in his collection.\n\nThere is also another approach that we can use to solve this problem. We can find out how many leaves were in the collection after the leaves broke and subtract it from the total number of leaves. So, 89-43=46. We can then subtract the total number of leaves lost from the number of leaves that were in the collection after the leaves broke. 46-24=22.

But the possible answers only gave a few numerical choices to pick from, instead of giving an answer in the form of an equation. To solve this problem, we had to create an equation and solve it.\n\nFrom the information given in the question, we know that Tom has $19 and one folder costs $2.\n\nSo, we can set up an equation: 19 = 2X, where X is the number of folders that Tom can buy.\n\nTo solve this equation, we need to divide both sides by 2. This gives us 19/2 = X.\n\nSo, we can see that Tom can buy $\\frac{19}{2}$ folders.\n\nBut the question only gave a few possible answers to choose from. So, we need to round this answer to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round up to 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that Tom can buy 9 folders."}

This implies a) we need the same amount of oil in every barrel and b) there should be no leftover oil after filling the last barrel.\nIn the least number of barrels that meet those two conditions, the number of large barrels must equal the number of small barrels. This gives us a total of 15 barrels. 5 × 15 = 75, which is less than the total amount of oil (95) but more than the amount of oil that one large barrel can hold. Therefore, there must be 10 additional small barrels, giving a total of 25 barrels. 25 × 5 = 125, which is more than the amount of oil in each barrel.

The question is asking about what would minimize the number of groups.\n\nThe most logical first step is to look at how many 7's we can fit into 90. We are able to fit 12 7's, so we know we are going to have 12 groups of 7.\n\nNow that we know how many groups of 7 we have, we need to find out how many groups of 3 we can have. Since each group of 7 has 7 dancers, each group of 3 has 3 less. Since there are 90 dancers, the 12 groups of 7 have 84 dancers. This leaves 6 dancers that will make the 13th group of 7, giving us 12 groups of 7 and 1 group of 3.```"}

The total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g, so the average weight of a watermelon and a pineapple is 3.9 kg. To calculate the difference between a watermelon and a pineapple, we first need to find the average weight of a watermelon. The total weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g, so the average weight of a watermelon is 5.2 kg.

The first number is 5, because each cup has five packages. Similarly, the second number is 10, because each plate has ten packages. Now, to find out how many packages of each product we need to buy, we use the following equation: 5x = 10y. This equation can be solved by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us x = 2y. This means that we need to buy two packages of each product. Since we want to have the same number of each item for the party, this is the least number of packages we need to buy.```\n"}

Since we have to double the number first, we can double 32 to make 64 and add 3 to it, which results to 67. If we look at the pattern, we notice that after we double a number, we just need to add 3 to the new number, which results to 3 more than the previous number. Thus, we should add 6 to 16 to make 22. Then we should add 3 more to it to make 25. That means Jordan's machine is actually adding 6 to the input.

What number do you think Jordon put in her machine?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "52", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: I think 52 was the initial number, because if the machine was doubling it would double to 106, and then 3 more is 109. But if the machine was doubling and then adding 4 more it would be 114, and 27 does not equal 114. I think it would be adding 3 more to the initial number, because when it was doubled it would be 104. And if it was adding 4, then it would be 108, and that would not equal 27. I think it would be 52, because 2x52 is 104, and then 104+3 = 107, and 107 does not equal 27. So I think it would be adding 3 more to the initial number.\n"}

Then after Drew gives 12 marbles to Marcus, Drew has $d - 12$ marbles, and Marcus has $m + 12$ marbles. The question asks for how many more marbles Drew had than Marcus at first, so we can calculate the difference between $d$ and $m$. Now we use the information given in the question to get a system of equations:\n\n$$\nd - m = 12\\\\\nd - m = 25 - 12 = 13\n$$\n\nThus, we have that $d = 38$ and $m = 13$ and so the answer is $38 - 13 = 25$.

{"question": "Martin works at the Hungry Hippo. He sells 48 hamburgers before 6 o'clock. He sells 28 more hamburgers than that after 6 o'clock. He works 24 hours each week. How many hamburgers does Martin sell after 6 o'clock?", "correct answer": 76.0, "llm answer": "124", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: If we reason according to the given information in the question, we should first know that the sum of 28+76=104, which is 56 greater than the number 48 that Martin sold before 6 o'clock, but Martin sold a total of 76 hamburgers before 6 o'clock, 56 hamburgers greater than 76, which is 56 hamburgers greater than the sum of the two sums before 6 o'clock.\n\nTherefore, we can find that Martin sold 56 hamburgers before 6 o'clock. But the question didn't ask us how many hamburgers Martin sold after 6 o'clock, but asked us how many hamburgers Martin sold before 6 o'clock. So, according to the keywords of the question, we know that the given answer should be 48, not 124. But this is just our reasoning, not the standard, so the answer of this question should be '0'.\n\n\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)\npd.options.display.max_columns = None\nimport numpy as np\nnp.set_printoptions(threshold=np.inf)\n```\n"}

The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. The greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 16.\nTo find the number of tables, we need to find the largest factor of 32 that divides into both 12 and 20. Let us start with the smallest factor, which is 2. Since 2 is a factor of 32, we need to divide 12 and 20 by 2. Now we have 6 adults and 10 children. We need to divide 6 by 2 again since it is not divisible by 4. We now have 3 adults and 10 children. We can't divide by 2 again since 3 is not a multiple of 4. So we move on to the next factor of 32, which is 4. Since 4 is a factor of 32, we need to divide 20 by 4. We now have 5 adults and 5 children. We can't divide by 4 again since 5 is not a multiple of 8. So we move on to the next factor of"}

We're told that Erica and Sam have a total of 91 dollars and we're also told that Sam has 38 dollars. So if we add 38 to 91 we'll get 129, which means that Erica must have 38. However, the options aren't given in the correct order (I mean the order they should appear in to make the correct answer easier to find). I think that the answer should be the one that comes first in the options. Also, it's mentioned in the question that the keywords are relevant to the answer, so I don't think the answer should be about subtraction. Also, it's obvious that Sam's and Erica's total money is a multiple of 9 because 91 and 38 are both divisible by 9. The numbers in the options are not divisible by 9 except the number 53, which is 5 * 9 + 8. This means that Erica has 5 times 9 plus 8 dollars. I don't think there is any chance for Erica to have 17 dollars because the numbers in the options are positive numbers. I think Erica has 5 times 9 dollars because Sam is 38 dollars"}

The 7 bouncy balls are not important to the problem. \n\nThe question asks us to find \"How many more packs of red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls did Miki buy?\" In order to find this, we need to find the difference in number of packs of red bouncy balls and yellow bouncy balls. This would be 4 packs of red bouncy balls minus 3 packs of yellow bouncy balls. The difference is 1 pack.\n\nSo the answer is 1 pack.\n"}

It's a contradiction, thus the marked price can not be 150. \nThe same process can be applied to the other answers. \nOnly the case of 180 leads to a valid fraction on the right-hand side.

So, the total amount of compost is 4200g + (1/4 x amount of barrel) = 4200g + 1/4 * X = 4200g + X/4\n- Reasoning: The correct answer is 4200 g. The question states that Jemma filled one-fourth of a barrel with compost on Saturday, so 1/4 of the barrel was filled with compost. She also filled the remaining space with 4200 g of compost, so 3/4 of the barrel was filled with compost. Since 1/4 of the barrel was already filled with compost, the remaining 3/4 was filled with 4200 g of compost, making the"}

Since there are two operations in the statement, it is not sufficient to convert it to one equation only.\nSo first we get the statement:\n```\n(n + 3n) = 20\n```\nand then we get the equation:\n```\n4n = 20\n```\nTherefore, $n = \\frac{20}{4}$, or $n = 5$.\n\nAnd the keywords \"Added\", \"thrice\", \"20\" might be important for the equation since in this equation, \"plus\" is equivalent to \"added\" (both have the meaning of addition). The same for \"thrice\" which is equivalent to multiplying something by three, the \"20\" is the sum of the addition and multiplication. \n\nThere are other ways to solve this question, but in this particular situation, it might be easier for the model to use keywords to figure out which operation to use to convert the statement to the equation."}

Find the numbers.", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "5 and 7", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n```\n```\n\nIn this particular problem, since we are able to write the sum of two consecutive odd numbers as a sum of 6 ones and 1 more than that (the last 1) as 6+1+1+1+1=20, it is easy to see that the two numbers are 5 and 7. Also, since the first number is odd, the sum of the two numbers must be odd. Therefore, 20 must be an odd number. Thus, the second number is an even number (or an odd number plus 1). This leads to 19, 17, 15, 13, and 11 as possible values for the first number. Among these numbers, 5 is the only odd number. Also, the sum of any other pair of consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 3 (or 2), which contradicts 20 not divisible by 3. Therefore, the answer must be 5 and 7.\n```"}

{"question": "If one pack of gum costs $2,. how many packs of gum can you buy with $16?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this question, we are asked to find out how many packs of gum can be bought with $16 if one pack costs $2. We can use our knowledge of multiplication to find the answer. Multiplication is a way to find the product of two or more numbers. For example, $2\\times 4=8$, which means that the product of $2$ and $4$ is $8$. In this question, we need to find the product of $16$ and the cost of one pack of gum, which is $2$.\n\nLet's first make sure we understand the problem. We have $16$ dollars and we want to buy some packs of gum that cost $2$ dollars each. The question is asking us how many packs we can buy. To find the answer, we need to multiply $16$ by $2$.\n\n$16\\times 2=32$, so we can buy $32$ packs of gum. However, it is unlikely that we will be able to buy exactly $32$ packs, because we do not have exact change and the packs of gum are likely to be sold in quantities of $8$ or $16$ packs. In fact, it is very unlikely"}

We were only told that $14.00 covered half of the cost.\n\n> \"$14\" and \"$28\" are keywords, and it looks like \"14 * 2\" equals $28. However, we were not given the price of the gift. So, we can't add $14 to $14 to get $28.\n\n> So, I think it is most likely that the cost of the gift is $28.00. It is $14.00 in the first place, and there is a reason it is called half the cost. In other words, $14.00 is only half the cost of the gift, which makes the cost $28.00.\n\nAnswer: I think the correct answer is $28.00.\n\n"}

First, we know that Katie ran more than 35 miles, so 35 is not correct. 2. We also know that Katie ran 25 miles less than Adam, so the answer is not 60 miles. 3. Since we know Katie ran less than Adam, we can rule out answers 40, 50, and 75 miles. 4. Since we know Katie ran less than Adam, the answer cannot be 80 miles, since 80 > 35+25 = 60. 5.

The equation `y-x=13` can be rewritten as `x+y=26` since the `+x` is on the other side of the equals sign. We now have `x+y=35` and `x+y=26`, so we can find `x` and `y`. We have `x+y=35`, so subtract `x` from both sides to get `y=x+35-26=9`. Then substitute `9` for `y` in the first equation to get `x+9=35` and `x=26`. So the two numbers are `x=26` and `y=9`, which sum to 35 and differ by 13. \n\nThe confidence of 50% is not correct because we don't have information on the relative magnitude of `x` and `y`.

We need to know what is a perimeter.\nA perimeter is a path that surrounds a two-dimensional shape. The shape below has four sides and each side has a different length.\nThe word `perimeter' is very similar to the word `perimetre', which comes from the Greek word `peri' (meaning around) and `metron' (meaning measure).\n\nThe perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.\nFor polygons, you can use the formula\n`P = a + b + c + d'\nwhere a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the shape.\nThe perimeter of a shape with four sides of equal length is\n`P = 4s'\nwhere `s' is the length of one side.\n\nThe postcard is 6 inches wide, so the width is `w = 6 inches'.\nThe perimeter of the postcard is `P = 20 inches'.\nWe can find the length, `h', by subtracting `w' from `P':\n`P = 20 inches = 6 inches + 2h'\n`20 inches - 6 inches = 2h'\n"}

We are given Edward had 763 baseball cards in 7 binders. If each binder has the same number of cards. We can represent this situation with an equation: 7b=763, where b represents the number of cards in each binder. By solving the equation, we get b=109. Therefore, 109 cards are in each binder.\n\n\n2. However, this is not the most efficient method of finding the answer. We can use the concept of divisibility to find the answer. A number is divisible by another number if it can be divided by that number without leaving a remainder. In this case, since 7 is a prime number, it can only be divisible by 1 and 7. Therefore, we can divide 763 by 7 to find out how many times it goes into 763 without leaving a remainder. 763/7=109, which means that 109 cards are in each binder.\n"}

If we assume Cody had 36 boxes, then we would divide 243 by 36, which is equal to 6.7.\n\nThe answer can be reached by looking for the keywords \"243 kg\" and \"36 boxes.\" The keywords indicate that the total weight of the boxes is 243 kilograms. Since the boxes are assumed to be of equal weight, we can use division to find the individual weight of a box. The total weight divided by the number of boxes equals the individual weight of a box. Therefore, the individual weight of a box is 243 kilograms divided by 36, which is equal to 6.7 kilograms.\n\nBy rewriting the question using keywords and then applying basic arithmetic, we can conclude that the correct answer is 6.7 kilograms.\n```Confidence: 100%```"}

So we cannot simply divide the total number of books sold by the ratio of books to bookmarks to get the number of bookmarks sold. However, the keyword 'the ratio of books to bookmarks sold' still provides us with some information about the ratio between books and bookmarks sold. So we can use this information to calculate the possible answer.\n\nFor example, if the ratio is 9:2, then we can say that the number of books sold is 9 times greater than the number of bookmarks sold. Since the total number of books sold is 72, we can say that the number of bookmarks sold must be greater than 72 / 9 = 8. So we can say that the number of bookmarks sold must be between 8 and 72.\n\nHowever, the keyword '9 books' does not provide us with any new information.

I can calculate the number of cakes that the baker initially had by plugging in the known numbers into the equation that matches the keywords ['12 - n', '3', '12 - n = 3', '9 = n'], which is '12 - n = 3'.

In this case, the original question is 'how many apples does he still have after using 8 for making a pie?' (the target answer is 6). By asking the question in a way of 'how many apples would he still have?' (which asks 'how many apples does he have in total'), the answer of 14 is also plausible. \n\n* Confirmation bias: The question asks how many apples would he still have after using 8, and hence it encourages people to confirm that 8 apples are used, instead of thinking about the whole process of using 8 apples.\n\nQ: What can be done to mitigate those biases?\n* Framing bias: The original question needs to be clearly expressed.\n* Confirmation bias: The question is written to make it easier to understand, and can potentially be written in a way to guide readers not to fall into the trap of confirmation bias. \n\n"}

The question asks \"how many snakes were not hiding\", which means we're looking for the number of snakes not hiding, and it asks that because we know the number of snakes hiding.\n2. We also know the total number of snakes is 68.\n3. Therefore, if we can get the number of snakes not hiding, then it is the answer. \n\nI see two ways to do so, let's analyze:\n\nOption 1: `total snakes - snakes hiding = snakes not hiding`\n\nIf the number of snakes hiding is 42, then the number of snakes not hiding is 68 - 42 = 26\n\nOption 2: `snakes not hiding = total snakes - snakes hiding`\n\nIf the number of snakes not hiding is 26, then the number of snakes hiding is 68 - 26 = 42\n\nSince either option 1 or 2 will give us the right answer, then I think it's safe to say that the answer is 42.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 42 to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```"}

Each serving must contain a chunk of both types of fruit. The first assumption to make is that there are 30 servings of the fruit salad.

This would make it so that each serving could have a different number of chunks of each type of fruit, but the correct answer needs to be one serving that is consistent throughout. In the question, the problem also states that the correct answer should maximize the number of servings, so it makes sense that there are not 0 servings. There are several ways to think about this problem.

Second, the keywords provide some information but there is not enough to eliminate all the possible answers. For example, even though 15 is a higher number than 4, it is not clear if the teacher has completed grading a certain amount of worksheets (which is why the question asked 38 worksheets to grade), or if she has to grade the next 15 worksheets on top of the already graded 4 worksheets. Therefore, since the wording of the question does not specify anything and there is not enough information to eliminate other possible answers, we think that the answer is still 19.\n"}

However, I think the reasoning here is still sound.\nThe most direct way I think about this problem is to imagine Luke spending 48 dollars on a purchase, and then spending 11 dollars to make another purchase. Then he gets 21 dollars from his mom. I could then write this out with symbols:\n```A - B + C = D```\nWhere the letters are numbers, A = 48, B = 11, C = 21, and D = 58.\n\nI then think about how to transform the question to find the probability that D is 58, without knowing anything about the numbers, or assuming that they are specific numbers. Then I think about how to transform that into a probability question for the system.\n\nFirst I transform the original question to be:\n\n```D = A - B + C```\n```A - B + C = 58```\nThen I say that the numbers could be any value. This would mean that the probability that the A is any value is 1. Because any number is possible. The probability that B is any value is also 1. Same"}

Each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?\n2. The answer is 12 because if each enemy gives you 3 points, and there are 4 enemies left, then 3 points x 4 enemies = 12 points.\n3. The question asked how many points would you earn, not how many enemies you would defeat.\n4.
