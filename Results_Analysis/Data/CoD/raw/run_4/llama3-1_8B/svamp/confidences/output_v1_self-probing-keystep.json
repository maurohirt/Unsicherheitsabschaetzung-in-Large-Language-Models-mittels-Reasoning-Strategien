The purpose of this project is to explore such questions from an information theoretic perspective. For example, what information is needed to answer the question above? To answer this question, we start with a simple model of what constitutes a correct answer. In this model, correct answers are determined by some probabilistic generative model $p(y \\mid x)$, i.e. there exists some hidden state $x$ that we are not observing. Then the answer is correct if the prediction of the model $p(y \\mid x)$ matches the observed answer $y$. Based on this generative model, we define the model likelihood of an answer as\n\\[l(y) = \\log p(y \\mid x)\\]\nWe assume that the probability of an answer being correct is independent of how likely the answer is. Then if we are able to correctly predict the answer to a question with model likelihood of $l(y)$, then the number of bits that we need to describe the question is\n\\["}

So he earns 1357 every week, for 223 weeks. That's 1357*223=300781.\nAssume Lewis has 73 harvest seasons. So he earns 1357*73=98841 every year, for 73 years. That's 98841*73=7209233.\nAssume Lewis's earning increases 10% every season, or every year. So in the first year, Lewis earns 1357. In the second year, he earns 1357*(1+0.1)=1487. In the third year, he earns 1487*(1+0.1)=1643, and so on.\nIf you calculate 1357*223, then 1357*223*1.1, and 1357*223*1.1^2, and then keep multiplying by 1.1, you will get the following series: \n1357, 1487, 1643, 1815, 2003, 2207, 2432, 2672, 2933, 3214, 3516, 3843, 4195, "}

If it is a correct answer, Paco had 75 cookies left. The problem is that the answer 75 is not the one given. However, I assume we only have 4 possible answers to choose from: 60, 70, 75, and 80. So my reasoning is as follows:\nSuppose that I got the answer to the above question. I assume the answer is either 60, 70, 75, or 80. I also assume that the possible answers are equally likely.\nSo, there is 25% chance that the answer is 60. If that is the case, Paco has 60 cookies left.

If we use critical reasoning step, we get 11x. We also know that there are 20y, so we know that 11x=20y. We can divide by 11 to get 1x=20y/11. Since we know that y>11, we have 1x<y. This means that x<y. We also know that there are x roses and y orchids in the vase, so there are y-x roses and y orchids in the vase. Since y-x>0, we have y-x>0. We can subtract y-x from both sides of the inequality to get 0>x-y. We can also divide by y-x to get 0>x-y/y-x. We know that y-x>0, so we can multiply both sides of the inequality by y-x to get 0=x-y. We also know that x>0, so we can add x to both sides of the inequality to get x=x.

Could you assume that they are chosen uniformly and randomly? Why or why not?\n\nYes, we assume they are chosen uniformly and randomly. This is a reasonable assumption. The number of invitation packs chosen would be the same as the number of friends, since Carol sends each friend the same number of invitations.\n\nThe way to answer the question is to use the fundamental counting principle, which says: ```n(A * B) = n(A) * n(B)``` which applies here since the selection of the invitation packs is independent from the selection of friends. We can do a lot of quick elimination of answers that we know to be incorrect.\n\nSo, for 2 invitations in each pack, if we have ```n(A) = n(friends)``` we would need ```n(B) = n(packs) = floor(n(A) / n(B))``` since there would have to be some leftover packs if we were to have more than the number of packs equal to the number of friends (or we would be giving more than 1 invitation to some friends).

Therefore, there are 4 more odd numbers than even numbers in the set of 19 numbers. Since 19 is the only even number, it is the number of catfish.

The answer is 0.\n\nThere are other ways to tackle this question, such as counting the total number of operations he made and using the fact that for every added app there are three other options for it to appear in the final set: 1 - added and deleted, 2 - added and not deleted, 3 - not added and deleted. Then we know that he added 71 - 3*14 = 71 - 42 = 29 apps. Hence, he deleted 79 - 29 = 50 apps, and since 50 is divisible by 5, 79 must be the answer.

It is not \"Completed\" pages of math + reading. This is not mentioned in the question.

{"question": "Kelly gives away 91 nintendo games. How many did she have initially if she still has 92 games left?", "correct answer": 183.0, "llm answer": "91", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: 91 games given away\nReasoning: The question states that Kelly gives away x games, and she has y games left. The answer choice is also x games. There are two possibilities:\n\nOption 1: x + y = x. The equation only has one unknown (x) and one variable (y), so we can easily solve for x: x + y = x. This means that the total number of games given away plus the number of games left is equal to the number of games given away. Since the total number of games is y, this means that Kelly started with y games. Therefore, the answer is y games.\nOption 2: x + y = y. This is impossible, since y would have to be zero. This is not possible, since the question states that Kelly has y games left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option 1. The most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer is recognizing that the equation can be solved by setting x + y equal to x, since there are no other variables in the equation."}
{"question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 106 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 242 t-shirts. If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How many t-shirts did they sell during the Texas tech game?", "correct answer": 127.0, "llm answer": "127 t-shirts", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: There are 2 ways to approach this problem, one way is to use reasoning and the other is to use math. However, the key point in this question is to realize that there is a missing variable.\n\nBy looking at the answer choices, it is clear that the possible answers are not multiples of 6. By reasoning, we realize that the total number of t-shirts should be a multiple of 6. Therefore, we know that the number of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game is not 115 t-shirts, it must be 114 t-shirts.\n\nTherefore, the total number of t-shirts sold in the 2 games is 114 + 128 = 242.\n\nWe can see that the Arkansas game sold 114 t-shirts and the Texas tech game sold 128 t-shirts.\n\nThe confidence given by the author is to show that this reasoning step is clear and the answer is unique.\n\nAnother reasoning approach is as follows:\nWe can use the total revenue of $106 for each t-shirt, the number of t-shirts sold in the Arkansas game 115, and the total number of t-shirts sold in both games to determine the revenue in the Texas tech game.\n\nRevenue for the Arkansas game: 106 * 114 = $12054"}

How many books did he sell in the garage sale?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "73", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\nExplanation: From the given information we know:\nP(books sold) + P(books given to friends) = 62 – 108 = 46 books\nThus, 35 = books given to friends\nand\nP(books sold) = 46 – 35 = 11 books\nHence the possible answer is: 73 books\n\nNow we need to check if 73 can be equal to P(books sold). This is done by checking if 73 books sold is a possible value. For that we use the constraint:\nP(books sold) < 108 – 62 = 46\nAnd the given answer 73 fits in the constraint so we conclude that 73 is the possible answer.\nIn order to reason the probability of the possible answer to be correct, you need to reason that the total number of possible answers to the given question is 2 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 200, and given the constraint and the fact that 62 is the total of the possible answers of the two questions, the probability of 73 to be correct is (46 / 200) = 0.23."}

How many more apples than peaches does Steven have?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nA: We can be relatively confident that the answer is indeed 3 because Steven only has 12 peaches and Jake has 3 fewer, meaning that Jake has 9 peaches. However, Steven has 15 apples, 10 more than Jake, meaning that Jake has 5 apples. Hence, Steven has 5 more apples than Jake. Jake, having 5 apples fewer than Steven, must have had 12 apples initially, so the answer is 3.\n\nExplanation: We start by assuming that Jake has 0 peaches and 0 apples (as in the original question). Then we can use the information about the change in number of peaches and apples to deduct how many peaches and apples Jake has now. Once we have the new amounts, we can calculate how many apples Steven had to have originally.\n\nWe know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can write the equation $$12-3 = 9$$, which means that Jake has 9 peaches. Similarly, we can write $$15-10 = 5$$ to say that Jake has 5 apples.\n\nSteven must have 5 more apples than Jake, so we subtract 5 from the number of apples that Jake has. Since Jake"}

How much did Edward have before he spent his money?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "$53", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75% \n\nExplanation: This problem is easy to solve in this way: $6=$16-$10.\nHowever, the main focus of this problem is on how one might reason about the possibility of various outcomes, which requires more reasoning and less calculation. \n\nFirst, since Edward spent $16 for 92 books, then he spent $16/92=$0.17 for one book. Hence the unit price of one book is $0.17. Note that we can also solve this problem in this way: 92*($16/92)= $16, 92 books cost him $16, or $16/92=$0.17, one book cost him $0.17. Second, since Edward has $6 left, then he spent $6 on books. Hence, he had $6/0.17= $35 left. Therefore, he had $35 + $16=$51 before he spent money.\n\nHowever, if we don't know how much money he has left, then we have to reason about the possibility of other outcomes. For example, if the unit price of a book is $0.25, then he would spend 6/0.25=$24 on books, leaving him $16-$24=$-"}

How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?", "correct answer": 89.0, "llm answer": "91", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nAnswer: 91\n\nExplanation:\nWe need to find the difference between the number of pastries and cakes sold. Therefore, 97 cakes were sold. We need to find the number of pastries sold. We know that he baked 14 cakes and 153 pastries. Hence, he sold 97 cakes. Since he made 14 cakes, he must have sold 14 cakes, hence he must have sold 153 - 14 = 139 pastries. Since we are told that he sold 8 pastries, we subtract 8 from 139 to find the number of pastries unsold. 139 - 8 = 131 pastries. Therefore, 131 pastries are unsold. He has 97 cakes and 131 pastries. Therefore, 97 - 131 = -34 cakes and pastries are unsold. Hence, the baker sold more cakes than pastries. The correct answer is 91."}

The most critical step in solving this problem is knowing the amount of apples and peaches that Steven has, therefore the reasoning should be in terms of Steven's peaches. \n\nTo reason about Jake, let's first consider that \"Jake has 84 more apples and 10 fewer peaches than Steven\". We can reason that since Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, he also has 10 fewer apples than Steven. If this is the case, Jake will have 10 fewer peaches than Steven, 10 fewer apples than Steven, and thus, the same ratio of peaches to apples as Steven.\n\nIf Jake has the same ratio of peaches to apples as Steven, we can reason about the ratio of Steven's peaches to apples and what Jake's peaches to apples ratio must be.

(This is a reasonable assumption to make.) So, if Matthew gave an equal number of crackers to all 11 friends, each friend must have received five crackers. Now, since Matthew gave an equal number of cakes to all 11 friends, each friend must have received three cakes. (Because the 11 cakes that were left over are more than enough to be evenly divided between the 11 friends, without any remainder. (11 cakes evenly divided by 11 friends = 1 cake per friend, with 0 left over.)) Since Matthew gave the remaining cakes (11 cakes) to his 11 friends, each friend must have received 1 cake.

I think that 7 is definitely the only possible answer because I did the same reasoning as well.

{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "correct answer": 44.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nI think the answer is 2. Since there are 193 pages, the book has an average of 15 pages per chapter, which means that the total number of chapters in the book is 193 divided by 15 = 12.75. Therefore, Frank must have read around 12.75 chapters per day to finish the book in 660 days. Given that the number of chapters is not a whole number, it is reasonable to round it up to 13, meaning that Frank would have read 13 chapters per day on average. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Frank was reading through his favorite book, indicating that he may have been motivated to read more than the typical person, thus justifying the rounding up of the number of chapters.

If not, why not?\nNo, the answer is 4 because the question is not asking how much time Ryan spends on learning english. It is asking how much more time Ryan spends on learning english than he does on learning chinese. Since it is asking about the difference, the answer would be 4.\n\n## Discussion\nIf the answer is 4, this means that Ryan spends 4 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. This is because 6-2=4, so the difference is 4. However, if the question is asking how much time Ryan spends on learning English, then the answer would be 6, as that is the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English. It's important to read the question carefully and understand what it is asking before providing an answer.\n\nTo solve this, you need to subtract the number of hours spent on Chinese (2) from the number of hours spent on English (6) to get"}

If anything, it's the opposite case, that she has more reading homework than math homework. It's possible you intended \"yet\" to mean \"not yet,\" i.e., that she needs to complete all her math homework and then she'll have 5 pages to go. But then I wonder why \"yet\" is even in there at all, since it doesn't provide any more information than just stating \"5 pages of math and 5 pages of reading.\" (Unless the point is that she already started working on the math homework.)\nSecond, it's not clear to me that Rachel has to complete all of her math homework.

Okay, here the question asked. After Jessie, started to go jogging every day. She lost 126 kilograms. She currently weighs 66 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog? Possible answer, minus 60 kilograms. Critical reasoning step lost weight 126 kilograms. Okay, so what I have done here is I have converted these two statements into two equations because we see here that the total weight lost is 126. Now we can easily see that if we subtract 66 from 126 we get 60 and here we have our answer. So our answer is, minus 60 kilograms. If we think that this statement lost weight 126 kilograms is irrelevant to this question, and we can't use it. And if we think that the correct answer is minus 60 kilograms and we can't use this statement. Then we can get 20% here. Because if we think this statement is irrelevant and we don't use it and also the answer is wrong, then there is a 20%"}

If we assume they all are different and there are 28 children, and no adults are playing (so there is a total of 16 boys and 12 girls), there are 28! ways of arranging them, so that would be 28! / 16!*12! = 1,185,120 (this is the total number of possible arrangements). Let's say x of those arrangements have 16 children playing on tuesday. 27!/(16! x) is the number of arrangements that have 27 - x children playing on tuesday, which is also the number of arrangements that have 12 more children playing on monday (we want to see how many of these possible arrangements fit the condition of having 16 children on tuesday and 28 children on monday).

How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?", "correct answer": 77.0, "llm answer": "77 - 231 = -154", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nExplanation:\nI don't understand the reasoning here, but if you can explain it to me, then I'll upvote and select the answer.\nMy reasoning is that if Paul got 267 crayons for his birthday, and during the school year he lost 231 and gave 308 away, then the number of crayons he has at the end is 267 - 231 - 308, and that's the number I was trying to get to. Of course I forgot the negative sign, but that's not an issue here, we'll see that it's the correct answer after we show our reasoning.\n\n1. If he lost 231 crayons that means he has 267-231=36 left, and that 36 is the starting point of the whole calculation.\n2. After he gives away 308 crayons he has 36-308=-272 crayons left.\n3. We know that in the end he has -272, that means we need to start from -272 and add 231 crayons to get the number that he lost. -272+231=-41\nThat's how I arrived at the answer. Of course it is possible to do it the other way around, start with 36 and add 308 to"}

This allows them to focus on evaluating your reasoning. So when they are answering they just need to think about what you said and whether it seems reasonable or not, they don't need to think about which other answers to compare to and what might the reasoning of other people be. Also if somebody is able to reason about all possible answers then that person is usually able to judge that answer better and more thoroughly. The fact that you got 43 doesn't mean it is your own answer, it means that you were able to come up with a calculation of some kind that leads to 43. I am not sure how it could be otherwise. It means that if someone else is reasoning about 43 then they can evaluate that. If they would evaluate only their own answer, they would need to compare it to other possible answers and they would need to be able to think what are the possible answers.

Let’s assume that X books were sold and Y books were left.

X = 137\n2. X < 137\n3. X > 137\n\nIn case 1, X is equal to 137, and since we know that there are 105 books left, we can say that Y is also equal to 105. Therefore, the probability of the answer being 242 is 0%.\n\nIn case 2, X is less than 137, which means that the number of books sold is lower than the number of books sold in case 1.

Answer 69 is the number of more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges that are harvested per day. If the farmers need to harvest twice as many sacks of unripe oranges as ripe oranges, the number of sacks of unripe oranges they need to harvest per day should be 2 × 5 = 10. But it's impossible to harvest 10 unripe oranges from 5 ripe oranges. If the farmers need to harvest more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges, the number of more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges should be less than 5. But 69 is greater than 5. So the statement \"The farmers need to harvest twice as many sacks of unripe oranges as ripe oranges\" is implausible."}

How many pages are in each chapter?", "correct answer": 198.0, "llm answer": "198", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\n\nExplanation: There are 594 pages in total and Frank took 607 days to read the book, which gives about 1 page/day. Since there are 3 chapters with the same number of pages, each chapter must have about 1/3 of 594 pages, which is about 198 pages.\n\nReason: We need to determine how many pages are in each chapter and the only option that divides 594 evenly is 198. If we take 594÷198, it gives us an answer of 3. Since the question states that the book has 3 chapters with the same number of pages, we can be certain that the possible answer is 198. Additionally, since there are 3 chapters and 594 total pages, we can deduce that each chapter must have 594÷3=198 pages.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

If the reasoning step is flawed, we should not count the confidence from the reasoning step. The reasoning step is flawed, as it does not differentiate oranges that are picked per day, while the question asks for oranges picked per week. The reasoning step leads to a wrong answer, but we can only assess how confident we are for the incorrect reasoning.

How many apples does Jackie have?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nA concise reasoning:\nThe question asks us to reason out with a logical conclusion.\nThe question only tells us two key facts: Adam has 9 apples and Adam has 3 more apples than jackie.\nTo solve this question, we first try to simplify the information to the simplest way: Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie, so Jackie has less than 9 apples. Now we need to figure out the possible answers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. With the given information, 9 is already the maximum of Jackies number of apples, so we can cross out 8 and 7. Now, we use the fact that Adam has 9 apples and figure out that Jackie has 6 apples.\n\nQ: The above reasoning seems correct, but the confidence is still a bit low, so how likely is the above answer to be correct?

How many points did he score per round?", "correct answer": 42.0, "llm answer": "42", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nQ: What is the most efficient way to verify the answer, other than checking the answer with the original question?\n\nQ: What type of reasoning skill are you demonstrating here?\n\nSolution: The most likely strategy for me is as follows: \n\nThe most important thing to realize is that the game is a trivia game. This means that the players have to answer questions. So, there is only one round and Luke can only play once. Therefore, the correct answer should be the number Luke gained per round.\n\nNow, since Luke has scored 84 points and he gained the same number of points each round, we can say that he scored 84/2 points per round. Then, we can do some more math and get 42. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is 42. This can be confirmed with the answer key. \n\nThe most likely reasoning skill I have demonstrated here is deduction. This is because I have used reasoning and logic to reach a conclusion. I have first looked at the original question and realized that it is a trivia game. Then, I have realized that there is only one round and Luke can only play once.

{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: There are two flower beds, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\nIf there were only 1 flower bed, they would have planted 36 seeds, and they planted 58 seeds in each flower bed, which is too many. That means they would have at least two flower beds. We can see that two flower beds is possible by planting 18 seeds in each bed, which is 36 seeds in total. We can also see that three flower beds is possible by planting 12 seeds in each bed, which is 36 seeds in total. We can see that four flower beds is impossible because they would have planted 9 seeds in each bed, which is too few, and they would have planted 36 seeds in total. We can see that six flower beds is impossible because they would have planted 6 seeds in each bed, which is too few, and they would have planted 36 seeds in total. We can see that 12 flower beds is impossible because they would have planted 3 seeds in each bed, which is too few, and they would have planted 36 seeds in total.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is: Paige planted 12 seeds in each of 3 flower beds,"}

The answer that is 45 falls into the valid range. Also, if you were to calculate the odds of 45 being correct out of the four choices, 45 is 100%.\n\nConfidence: 90%\n\nMy reasoning:\nIf the question was asking how many total flowers were grown, I would say there are 60 in each flower bed, so 2*60=120. However, because the question is saying \"they grew\" it is less likely that all 55 seeds grew into flowers. If only one out of two seeds grew, then only 60 out of 55 grew, so the remaining 5 grew into some other plant. If all 55 grew, then the total number of flowers grown would be 120.\n\nConfidence: 90%\n\nMy reasoning:\nI assumed that the question was asking about the total number of flowers grown, not the total number of flowers grown in each flowerbed.
