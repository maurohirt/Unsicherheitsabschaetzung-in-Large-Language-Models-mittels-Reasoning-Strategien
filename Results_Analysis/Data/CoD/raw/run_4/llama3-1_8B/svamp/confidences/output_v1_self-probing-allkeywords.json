How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 32.0, "llm answer": "1.67", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nReasoning: \"David did 58 more push-ups\" means that David's push-ups minus Zachary's push-ups is 58. Zachary did 35 push-ups. Thus David did 93 push-ups. Then Zachary did 3 crunches. David did 3 - 87 = 58 crunches. Then Zachary did 93 - 58 = 35 more push-ups than crunches. The answer is 1.67.\nConfidence: 100%\nReasoning: Since David did 58 more push-ups, this means David's push-ups - Zachary's push-ups is 58. Zachary did 35 push-ups, so David did 93 push-ups. Then Zachary did 3 crunches, while David did 3 - 87 = 58 crunches. Thus, Zachary did 93 - 58 = 35 more push-ups than crunches.\n"}

Therefore 90 - 154 = 36 tomatoes remained in the garden today.\n2. 50 tomatoes were picked today. Therefore 50 + 36 = 86 tomatoes were picked in total.\n3. 204 is not a possible answer, as 90 - 154 + 50 = 86.\n\n\n## Answer 2\n1. The original number of tomatoes in the garden was 90.\n2. The number of tomatoes picked yesterday was 154.\n3. The number of tomatoes remaining in the garden today was 36.\n4. The number of tomatoes picked today was 50.\n5. 36 + 50 = 86, so 86 is a possible answer, but 204 is not possible.\n\n## Answer 3\n1. The original number of tomatoes in the garden was 90.\n2. The number of tomatoes picked yesterday was 154.\n3. The number of tomatoes remaining in the garden today was 36.\n4.

We can find that the current day has more visitors. \n```r1 * 39 = 661\nr2 * 39 = 600```\nSince we can see that the current day has more visitors, we choose a higher number. We know that the number is a round number and there are 39 paintings so it must be a multiple of 39. We try to find out the value of r1 and r2 so we can find out the total number of people who visited. \n```r1 = 17.20512\nr2 = 15.38462```\nThen we can see the total number of people who visited are:\n```r1 + r2 = 32.58974```\nTherefore the answer is 32 visitors. We can see that the answer of 61 is incorrect, and we should choose another answer.\n\nThe reasoning part of the explanation is 80 words, which is more than 60 words.

Please explain how you derive this answer and how you reason for it. If you want to give a mathematical proof, please show it in your answer.\nIn the last part of the reasoning, we know that `11 sticks in all` and `71 flowers per pot`. Therefore, if we assume that we have `10011 flowers in total`, then there will be 10000-1=9999 sticks in total. However, 9999 is not divisible by 11, so we have to change the number. To make it divisible, we need to change either the number of flowers or the number of pots. As the question explicitly says \"each pot has 71 flowers\", we have to change the number of pots. So we add 1 to the number of pots (so there will be 142 pots). With 142 pots, we have `141*71=9971` flowers in total and `142*71=10092` sticks"}

How many pots are there in all?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n```\nReasoning: There are 40 flowers in a pot, there are a total of 400 flowers, thus there are a total of 400/40=10 pots. The reasoning to answer is based on the keywords 40 flowers, 10 pots and 400 flowers. As per the first statement of the reasoning, there are 40 flowers in a pot. This is equivalent to saying that there is 1 pot for every 40 flowers. Given there are 400 flowers, there will be 400/40=10 pots. This can be seen by counting that 40 flowers in a pot, 80 flowers in a pot, 120 flowers in a pot, 160 flowers in a pot, 200 flowers in a pot, 240 flowers in a pot, 280 flowers in a pot, 320 flowers in a pot, 360 flowers in a pot and 400 flowers in a pot which corresponds to 10 pots.

If he picked 2 potatoes. How many potatoes and tomatoes does he have left?\" As 2 - 1 = 1 and 3 - 2 = 1, the answer should be 2 tomatoes and 1 potato. With this simplification, we can get the first four keywords during reasoning and also the possible answer. The fifth keyword \"3\" is from \"175 - 172\" in the possible answer, and the sixth keyword \"95 + 3\" is also from the possible answer. As a result, we can know 3 and 98 in the possible answer, which means 175 - 172 = 3, and 98 + 3 = 101, the answer must be 101 - 3 = 98.

I also assumed that he did not have any extra crackers left over. If he had given each person 2 crackers, then there would have been 8 crackers, which is not the same as what he started with. The 10 crackers divided between 4 people is 2.5 crackers each. So, Matthew did not give all of the crackers to each person because he had less than 4 people, so each person only got 2.5 crackers. Each person got 2.5 crackers from Matthew because he divided the 10 crackers equally between 4 people.\n"}

If you have any mathematical reasoning, please include that too.\nWe know there were 3 roses in the vase, and there are now 19 roses in the vase. So, we just need to figure out how many roses were cut. We can solve this problem by using the \"change in quantity\" formula. This formula is: change in quantity = initial quantity - final quantity. In this case, the initial quantity is 3 roses, and the final quantity is 19 roses. So, we have: change in quantity = 3 - 19 = -16. This means that 16 roses were cut from the vase.

How many more bottles than apple did they have?", "correct answer": 98.0, "llm answer": "98", "confidence": 0.006, "probing response": "0.6%\nExplanation:\n\n```\nWe should first translate the sentence into an equation. Let x be the number of bottles of regular soda in the grocery store, and y be the number of bottles of diet soda in the grocery store. We can then build an equation. The total number of apples, bottles of regular soda and bottles of diet soda is 170. Thus, we have:\n    x + y + 36 = 170\nWe can then use this equation to solve for x and y. \n    x + y + 36 = 170\n    x + y = 134\n    y = 134 - x\nTherefore, x = 80, and y = 54. We have 80 bottles of regular soda, and 54 bottles of diet soda. There are a total of 80 + 54 = 134 bottles of soda in the store. \n```\n\nSince the correct answer is 98 (40 more bottles than apples) the correct answer to the above confidence is 40. However, the problem is the problem is actually wrong. Instead, there should be \"40 more apples than bottles\", which would lead to the correct answer to be 36.\nHowever, the keywords are also important since they give us"}

How many days would the soda bottles last?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "162/122 + 360/9", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nPossible reasonings are listed as follows:\n1. For the first part, debby drank 162 water bottles and had 162 left. For the second part, debby drank 9 soda bottles and had 360-9 = 351 soda bottles left. The fraction 162/122 was the result from the first part while the fraction 360/9 was the result from the second part, so they should be added together.\n\n2. There are 360 soda bottles, and she drank 9 soda bottles a day. So, she would drink 360/9 = 40 soda bottles a day. There are 162 water bottles, and she drank 122 water bottles a day. So, she would drink 162/122 = 1.33 water bottles a day. The total amount she would drink is 40 + 1.33 = 41.33 bottles. This is less than 40, so she would drink all 40 bottles on the first day, and she would drink the remaining 1.33 bottles in the second day.\n\n3. Debby drinks 122 water bottles a day, so she would drink 162 water bottles in 1.33 days. Debby drinks 9 soda bottles a day"}

But it is too big to be a number of books, because there are only 10 bookshelves. Also it is too big to be a number of magazines, because there are only 9 books. The correct answer should be between 9 and 46. And the correct answer should not be 9 because there are more than 9 magazines. But why not 46? It seems strange that there are 46 magazines but only 9 books. Also 46 is too big to be a number of books since there are only 10 bookshelves.

Include important keywords you find in the question for the reasoning:\n```\nIn the given answer, 27 bird families remain on the mountain. Since 26 new bird families came from the arctic, the 3 original bird families remain. This can be found by adding 26 + 3 and then subtracting 2 bird families. 26 + 3 - 2 = 27. \n\nIn the question keywords 'families' is important, since it is mentioned multiple times and the answer 27 refers to bird families. 'Families' means 'groups', which indicates that 3 original bird families + 26 new bird families = 29 bird families. However, since 2 bird families flew away, there were a total of 27 bird families left. Therefore, 3 original families + 26 new families - 2 leaving = 27 families left.

For example, the answer **95** will likely have low confidence, because it does not make sense in context: since there are only 94 bird families in total, there can't be more than 94 bird families flying away to asia.

{"question": "Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 249 pages and it took Frank 3 days to finish each book. How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 83.0, "llm answer": "747", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: To solve this, we can first simplify by considering the question in terms of hours rather than days, since hours are more granular. If Frank finishes 3 books in 3 days, then he finishes 1 book in 1 day, or 24 hours. There are 24 * 24 = 576 hours in 3 days. Therefore, Frank read 249 * 249 = 61,641 pages in 3 days. On average, then, Frank read 61,641 / 576 = 107 pages per hour. Since 8 hours is 1 day, this would be 107 / 8 = 13.375 pages per day.\n\nThe above reasoning is based on the assumption that the keyword information provided was relevant to the question at hand. If the provided information was not relevant, then the above reasoning would not be valid."}

How big is each group?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.951, "probing response": "95.1%\n\nExplanation: We first see that there are only two factors of 4950 and they are 5 and 99. We can't do much further with this observation so we try something else. We know that 4950 is 25 times the number of skittles so we know the number of erasers in each group will be 25 times the number of skittles. To find the number of factors of 3941, we need to know if there are any numbers between 1 and 20 (20 being the square root of 400, which is approximately the square root of 3941) that divide 3941. It's fairly obvious that 1 and 5 do. 5 divides 3941, so we know that 25 will divide the total number of erasers. That leaves us with 99. 1 and 3 divide 99 and 3 also divides 25. That means that 3*25=75 will divide the number of erasers and therefore the number of groups as well. Therefore, 75 must be a factor of the number of skittles and the number of groups. The only factor of 75 is 3. Since 75*3=225"}

{"question": "He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvested 54 sacks of oranges. How many days did it take to harvest them if they harvested 18 sacks of oranges per day?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3 days", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: As the total number of oranges is fixed, we can deduce the total number of days is the fixed value of oranges divided by the average number of oranges harvested per day. (18 oranges per day in this case.) \n\n```Possible Answer: 3 days\n```\n```Reasoning:\nThis problem can be solved by applying the concept of ratio. The ratio of oranges to days is 18:1.\nTo find the number of days, we can divide the total number of oranges by the ratio of oranges to days. \nThe total number of oranges is 54. So, dividing 54 by the ratio of oranges to days gives us 3.\nTherefore, the number of days is 3.\n```"}

How many more apples than peaches does Steven have?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Reasoning:\nWe want to know how many more apples than peaches Steven has. From the question, we know that Steven has 19 apples. We want to find out how many peaches Steven has and how many apples Steven has more than peaches. Therefore, we need to find the total number of apples that Steven has (19 + x) and the total number of peaches that Steven has (15 - x). Then, we can simply find the difference between the total number of apples and the total number of peaches that Steven has. Therefore, we need to solve for x, which is the total number of apples that Steven has more than peaches. From the question, we know that Steven has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. Therefore, we can write 19 + x = 15 - x + 3, which can be simplified to 2x = 2, or x = 1. We can now find the total number of apples that Steven has (19 + 1) and the total number of peaches that Steven has (15 - 1). Then, we can find the difference between the total number of apples and the total number of peaches that Steven has, which is 19 - "}

How many more hours does he spend on learning chinese than he does on learning english?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n```Reasoning:\nIf he spent the same amount of time on learning each language, he would learn 7 hours of english and 7 hours of chinese. Since the answer was given that he learns 6 hours of english and 7 hours of chinese, that means he learned one more hour of chinese than he did of english.\n\nI thought the answer was the number of hours spent on learning chinese more than the number of hours spent on learning english, but the given answer is the difference of those hours, so my reasoning is wrong.\n\nMy reasoning:\nThere are 24 hours in a day.

How much did they make in all?", "correct answer": 756.0, "llm answer": "756", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation:\nThe amount made in 44 days was 382, so to find the amount made in 10 days, we can subtract 382 from 374, because we know 374 was made in 44 days. The amount made in 10 days is 374 - 382, which is -8. The amount made in the first 54 days was 382 - 8 = 374. Then we can multiply by 2, because there are 2 54 day periods in a year. This is 374 x 2, which is 748. Then we can add 374, which is the amount made in the first 54 days, which is 748 + 374, which is 1122. Then we add 382, which is the amount made in the first 44 days, which is 1122 + 382, which is 1504. Then we can subtract 374, because we know 374 was made in 44 days, which is 1504 - 374, which is 1130. Then we can add 8, because we know -8 was made in 10 days, which is 1130 + 8, which is 1138.

How many trees died in the typhoon?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "16 trees", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: The answer has been written on the form of a fraction. Thus the difference between two consecutive fractions is one. So, for example, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4. In this fraction the only possible way to write the difference is by subtracting one from the fraction. Thus 4/4 - 1 = 3/4 which is the previous fraction. In the same way 16/20 - 4/20 = 12/20 - 4/20 = 8/20 - 4/20 = 4/20 - 4/20 = 0/20 which is a fraction of 0. This means that the answer is 0. 0 is 0% of 20. So we can say that the fraction can represent the answer to 95% of certainty.\nPossible Answer: 0 trees\nExplanation: The question mentions the number of trees to be 20, however the answer is 16. This means that the number of trees is not 16. The answer mentions 4 trees and we are looking for the number of trees that died in the typhoon. This means that 4 trees are left.

If she drank 54 soda bottles a day, she would only have 41 water bottles left at the end of the day. If she drank 41 water bottles a day, the water bottles would last for 180 ÷ 41 = 4.4 days. Debby drank 15 water bottles on the first day. If the water bottles lasted 4.4 days, Debby would have to drink 15 + 41 × 4.4 = 207.4 water bottles on the last day. Debby drank 180 water bottles, which is more than 207.4 water bottles. So the water bottles lasted more than 4.4 days. The answer is therefore 15.\n\n"}

It also tells us that he finds out that they harvest 16 sacks per day, each of them containing 57 oranges. The task asks us to find out how many days it takes to harvest 80 sacks of oranges.\n\nWe need to know how many oranges they harvest per day. This is given to us by multiplying the number of sacks (16) and the number of oranges per sack (57) which is `16*57=912`. The task asks us to find out how many days it takes to harvest 80 sacks of oranges. Therefore, we need to find out how many oranges we harvest per day divided by 80, which is `912/80=11.5`. As 80 is a whole number, this means we will have to harvest 11 sacks of oranges per day in order to harvest 80 sacks per day.\n\nFrom this we can calculate that we will have to harvest 11 sacks per day, which will take `80/11=7.272727273` days. In order to answer the task, we round up and say that it will take 8 days to harvest 80 sacks of oranges, which is"}

The base of the cave is at 0 feet. We know that they're at 849 feet, so the distance they have to go to get to the end of the cave is 111 feet. We know the speed that they're going, which is 17 feet per minute. If they're travelling at 17 feet per minute, then they can cover 17 feet in one minute. Therefore, in order to cover 111 feet they must go 6 times 17 feet in 6 minutes. That means that in order to cover 111 feet, they must go 6 times 17 feet in 6 minutes. That means that they will travel 111 feet in 6 minutes. The answer choices are all in minute and second intervals, so we have to figure out how many seconds that is.

How many crackers did each person eat?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\n### Answer\nThere are total 56 pieces of food, 22 crackers and 34 cakes. If Matthew gave equal number of pieces to his friends, each person will get 56/11 crackers and cakes. As it is given Matthew had 22 crackers, and total of 11 people. Therefore, each person will get 5 crackers.\nHowever, we can still not answer the question correctly yet. Because, the given question is about crackers, not about total food. Therefore, we must also check the answer choice about cakes.\n```\nIf 5 crackers + x cakes = 56/11 crackers, then\n5 + x = 56/11\nx = 56/11 - 5\nx = 1\n```\nAs Matthew gave equal number of crackers and cakes, each person gets 5 crackers and 1 cake. Therefore, each person gets 5 crackers.\n"}

Since there is only 8 working seats, 260 is the number of people who can ride at the same time. 260 / 15 people in each seat = 17.33 people. It is a floating number and the nearest number is 17. Therefore, there are 17 seats working which can hold 17 * 15 people each seat = 255 people. 255 / 18 seats is equal to 14.17 which is rounded to 14 people. So, there are 17 seats working which can hold 14 people each seat for a total of 238 people.```"}

Considering the reasoning you wrote in Q1, please briefly explain why your confidence is at 50% and why your answer to Q1 should be `Yes` or `No`.\n\nExplanation: If there are 182 students suggesting adding mashed potatoes, then there are 182+166=348 students suggesting bacon. We can't assume from this that the other 348-182=166 students have no preference on bacon vs mashed potatoes, but we don't know this. We also don't know that those who like mashed potatoes might also like bacon, or that those who like bacon might also like mashed potatoes. We don't know if the students who liked mashed potatoes have a different preference to those who liked bacon. There is no reason to think that there are more students who like bacon than mashed potatoes, or more students who don't like either. Therefore there is a 50/50 chance that the other 166 students preferred bacon. We can't be certain without more information, and so the answer is a 50/50 chance.\n\nPossible Answer: The answer is likely incorrect.\n```\nConfidence: [the probability of answer 348 to be correct, not the one you think correct,"}

We can rewrite it like \"He had 15-7 apps and 24-20 files on his phone\". Then the question is \"How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?\". Therefore, we should start from the \"He had 15-7 apps and 24-20 files on his phone\" and \"He had 8 apps and 4 files left\". Based on this information, we can calculate \"How many more apps than files does he have left on the phone?\".\nFirst, let's calculate the difference between the number of apps and files. Since there are 8 apps and 4 files, the difference between the number of apps and files is 8-4=4.\nNow, let's calculate the difference between the number of apps and files before deletion. Since there are 15 apps and 24 files before deletion, the difference between the number of apps and files before deletion is 15-24=-9.\nFinally, let's calculate the difference between the number of apps and files after deletion.

The first sentence implies that Doug had 16 marbles. So we can say that Doug now has 16 - 7 = 9 marbles. \n\nBecause we are told that Ed has 22 marbles, it is easy to see that Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug. \nThis means Doug had 16 marbles.\nSince Doug lost 7 marbles, he now has 16 - 7 = 9 marbles.\n\nSo the answer is 9.\n```"}

The candy bar costs $ 6 and the chocolate costs $ 3. To calculate the money spent on the candy bar, we subtract the cost of the chocolate from the cost of the candy bar.

Therefore the correct answer is 2 more birds than storks.\n\n\nExplanation: A better way to think about this problem is to take one side as a reference point, so there are 6 birds and 3 storks. The other side, that is the storks, increases by 2 storks. That means there are 2 storks more than birds. Therefore the correct answer is 2 more birds than storks."}

If it is to find the total number of students, then 1757 is unlikely to be the correct answer, because the number is too small for a school, but if the question is to find the number of girls, then 1757 is a good answer.

How many peaches does Jill have?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "20", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nComment:\nThis was a tricky one. The first sentence tells us that Steven has 18 peaches. We do not know if Jake has 18-12=6 peaches or 18+8=26 peaches. The second sentence tells us that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. If we substitute 18 for Steven, we get 6. If we substitute 26, we get 14. So, either Jake has 6 or 14 peaches. The third sentence tells us that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 18 peaches, then Jill has 10 peaches. If Steven has 26 peaches, then Jill has 18 peaches. Therefore, there is a 50% chance that the answer is 20 and 50% chance that the answer is 18.

The reason for our reasoning is that keywords help narrow down the possible answers and increase our confidence.\n\nThe keywords indicate that we are looking for a number that is greater than 10 pounds. This narrows down our possible answers to 16, 26, and 46. We can then check if 16 meets the conditions. If we subtract 10 pounds from 16 pounds, we get 6 pounds. Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 6 pounds more than Marco's strawberries.\n\nIt is important to note that we can't determine the exact weight of Marco's dad's strawberries without additional information. However, we can determine how much more he weighs than Marco, which is 16 pounds.\n\nTo answer this problem, we need to find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries.\nWe are given that Marco's strawberries weigh 10 pounds and that together, their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. We want to find how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weigh than Marco's.\nTo solve this problem, we can set up an equation. Let x be the weight of Marco"}

How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?", "correct answer": 44.0, "llm answer": "-34", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: \nThe word found indicates that the number of caps after the addition of the 50 new caps is more than the number of caps before the addition of the 50 new caps. So we can say that Danny found 50 new caps at the park, and he threw away 6 of the old ones. This means that he started with more than 50 caps, because if he started with 50 caps, he would have only 50 caps after throwing away 6 old caps. So Danny must have found more than 50 caps at the park. This means that Danny found at least 56 caps at the park. But he found 50 new caps at the park, which means he must have found at least 6 more caps at the park. So we can see that the answer is definitely not -34.\n"}

{"question": "Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair. If his hair is now 10 inches long. How long was his hair before he cut?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "30 inches", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation: Consider the following expression of hair length:\n```Robin cut off 20 inches of his hair. If his hair is now 10 inches long, how long was his hair before he cut?```\n\nThe expression can be rewritten as:\n```Before haircut: Robin's hair is X inches long. After haircut: Robin's hair is 10 inches long. Cut off 20 inches of hair during the haircut```\n\nThe before haircut and after haircut information are the only clues to determine Robin's hair length. So, by finding the difference between these two lengths, we can find the length of hair cut off. Thus, X = (10 + 20) inches = 30 inches.\n\nNote: The question is asking how long was Robin's hair before he cut. So, the answer should be in the past tense, not the present tense."}

How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.925, "probing response": "92.5%\n\nQ: I see that it is pretty easy to see that 11 is the answer but it seems more difficult to make confidence assessment from keywords, as it is a very low confidence. Can you elaborate on how you assess this answer to be correct?\n\nA: The keywords are '157', '169', '158', '147', '11' and the answer is 11. The numbers can be sorted in ascending order which is [11, 47, 57, 147, 157, 158, 169] where the answer is highlighted in bold. The number of cakes sold, 158, is the largest among the numbers not in bold and the number of pastries sold, 147, is the smallest among the numbers not in bold. Therefore, the difference of cakes sold and pastries sold is the sum of the largest number not in bold and the smallest number not in bold, that is 157. As the number of pastries sold, 147, is smaller than the number of pastries made, 169, so the number of cakes sold is larger than the number of cakes made, that is 157. Therefore, there are 11 more cakes than pastries sold."}

He is calculating how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day than unripe oranges. The oranges in sacks are oranges that have been harvested. Therefore, the ripe oranges and unripe oranges are referring to the oranges before they have been harvested. This means that we need to take the ripe oranges and unripe oranges that have been harvested and subtract the unripe oranges from the ripe oranges. This gives us 44 - 25 = 19. This is the answer.\n\nIf we need to explain how we got to the answer, we can say that we subtracted the unripe oranges from the ripe oranges to get the number of sacks of ripe oranges that were harvested. We then subtracted that number from the total number of sacks of ripe oranges that were harvested.
