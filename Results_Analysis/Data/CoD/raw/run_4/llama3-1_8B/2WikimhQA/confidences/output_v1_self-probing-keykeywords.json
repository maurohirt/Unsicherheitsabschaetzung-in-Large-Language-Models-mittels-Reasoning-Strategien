{"question": "Who is Judith Of Poland's paternal grandfather?", "correct answer": "Władysław I Herman", "llm answer": "Béla III", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\n\nI thought that it was most likely because it makes sense that Judith would be named after her grandmother. Also, from what I could find, this is not the only royal family with someone with that name, so it's not too special. The only other answer that made sense to me would be `King Andrew II of Hungary`, and `Kings Consort` were the last two possible answers. \n\nI'm also not too sure if it is possible to be a queen consort but not the daughter of a king consort or queen consort (as the question seems to imply) as the daughter of the King's brother is usually called the princess of a country and not the princess consort. I don't think that there's a princess consort position in the royal family, and so that leaves only `Queen consort`, which makes the most sense to me as a royal with that name would usually be someone who married a King or Queen, and not just a Queen. As of now, I believe that the most correct answer would be `King Andrew II of Hungary` due to the fact that this is a Queen consort, and not a King Consort.\n```"}

{"question": "Who is Sancha Of Castile, Queen Of Aragon's paternal grandmother?", "correct answer": "Urraca of León", "llm answer": "Elvira De Menez", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "0.5\n\nExplanation: I've assumed that by 'Queen Of Aragon' they mean 'Queen Consort of Aragon'. Elvira de Menez's father Ferdinand, and his son Alfonso II were both kings of Aragon and her daughter Berengaria was Queen consort of Aragon as the wife of Peter I of Aragon. The question states that she was the paternal grandmother of Elionor of Castile, the wife of Alfonso I of Aragon and so the mother of Peter I of Aragon, making her Alfonso I of Aragon's mother-in-law. If Elionor was Berengaria's maternal grandmother, Elionor Castile would have been her granddaughter rather than her mother. So, based on the above reasoning, the answer is 100% probable."}

This question requires a bit of logic to answer, but it can be done easily if you are willing to put in the effort.\n\nWe know that \"Maria\" is \"Maria of Galicia,\" and she is her father's \"daughter.\" We also know that her mother is \"King Peter's second wife.\" This means that her mother is either the second or third wife of King Peter, and therefore she has at least two wives.\n\nNow, we know that \"Peter\" is Galicia's \"father,\" which means he is her mother's husband. Since we know that Galicia has at least one sibling, we can assume that her father has at least one sibling as well.\n\nWe can now conclude that \"Maria\" is either the second or third child of her mother and father, which means that her father has at least two siblings.\n\nIt is important to note that this answer is not guaranteed to be correct, as there may be other factors that we are not aware of that could change the answer.

The second one, Viscount, tells us that the individual should have a high position in society. The last one, Plantagenet, tells us that we are probably looking for an individual from the Plantagenet dynasty.\n\nUsing the keywords we can narrow down the answer to be either King Henry VII, King Henry VIII, or Queen Elizabeth I. We can eliminate King Henry VII, as he is not the stepmother of Arthur Plantagenet. We can also eliminate King Henry VIII, as he is not the stepmother of Arthur Plantagenet. This leaves us with Queen Elizabeth I as the only possible answer.\n\nWe can also use our knowledge of the Plantagenet dynasty to eliminate other potential answers. Queen Elizabeth I was the daughter of King Henry VIII and Queen Anne Boleyn. King Henry VIII was the son of King Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville. Therefore, the answer must be someone who was married to a member of the Plantagenet dynasty, but was not a direct descendant of King Edward IV or Queen Elizabeth Woodville. The only possible"}
