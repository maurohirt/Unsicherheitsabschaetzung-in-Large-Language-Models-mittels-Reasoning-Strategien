If the answer is indeed Anthony Dryden, then every reasoning step is correct, and all information provided is relevant to that answer. In that case, the probability of that answer being correct is 1. However, considering the reasoning steps provided, I don't think that answer is correct. It looks like you are trying to trace a family lineage through multiple generations of marriages. From what I can gather, the only information that you have provided about John Vernou \"Jack\" Marshall's marriage is that his father is Daniel French Smith and his mother is Edith D. Smith. However, it looks like the reasoning steps provided indicate that Jack Marshall's mother is Catherine Louise Smith, and that Catherine Louise Smith is not a Smith by birth. It's not immediately clear how Catherine Louise Smith is related to Daniel French Smith, but it seems like the reasoning steps you have provided contradict each other. If Jack Marshall's mother is Catherine Louise Smith, then the reasoning steps should indicate that Catherine Louise Smith is Daniel French Smith's wife and the mother of Jack Marshall. It should also indicate that Daniel French Smith is the son of John Dryden and Catherine"}

Step 6 is the conclusion of 5. The reasoning is valid up to step 6, but it remains unclear who was Nicu's father.
