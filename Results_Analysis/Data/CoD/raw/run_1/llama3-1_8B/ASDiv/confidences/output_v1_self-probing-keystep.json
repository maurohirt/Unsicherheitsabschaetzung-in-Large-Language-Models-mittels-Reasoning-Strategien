We want to compare these two fractions: $$\\dfrac{14}{18} > \\dfrac{4}{18}$$ We also want to be able to say the following: $$\\dfrac{14}{18} > \\dfrac{4}{14}$$ However, we can’t, because 14 > 4 does not mean that $\\dfrac{14}{18} > \\dfrac{4}{14}$, as the following two examples illustrate: $$2 > 1 \\implies \\dfrac{2}{3} > \\dfrac{1}{3}$$ and $$3 > 2 \\impl"}

The first number is “Mrs. Hilt read 2 books per day” and the second number is “How many days did she read?”. The answer for the second number is 7, because we are talking about 7 days in a week. In summary, we need to multiply 2 books/day by 7 days to calculate how many books Mrs. Hilt read during a week. \n\nIn this specific example, we have a few steps in our reasoning process:\n1. First, we assume that Mrs. Hilt read 2 books per day.\n2. Then we assume that there are 7 days in a week.\n3.

The word 'got' is used twice in the question, which can be viewed as a 'got1' and a 'got2', and the verb 'got1' is followed by 'then'. Thus, the verb 'got2' can be viewed as another 'got1'. So, 'got1' means a borrowing action that happens before 'got2'. 'Got1' is used with the number 54, and 'got2' is used with the number 23. From the perspective of 'got1', which means that a borrowing happened before 'got2' and the number 54 was the total number of books that were already borrowed before 'got2', 'got2' is an additional borrowing action, so the number 23 is the new borrowed book, which is different from the first 54 books. From the perspective of 'got2', which means that 'got2' is the total borrowing action, the number 77 is the sum of 54 and 23. So, both the perspectives lead to the possibility of the answer 77.

If you think your reasoning is not as strong as 80% and the possible answer 37 pounds is not very likely to be correct, you may want to increase your confidence percentage to, for example, 90% and check if you can make the reasoning even stronger (perhaps with additional evidence) or not. On the other hand, if you think 80% is too low, you can lower it to 70% and check if you can still get a strong-enough reasoning (perhaps with additional evidence) or not. But do not make the percentage too high. For example, 95% would mean that you can be almost 100% sure that the answer 37 pounds is correct, and that would make it hard for you to make a strong-enough reasoning.

The question mentions that Mrs. Sheridan has 11 cats, not 12 or 10. It is reasonable to infer that this information is not for nothing, but the real answer lies in the relationship between 11 and the number of more cats Mrs. Sheridan needs.\n2. Given that the question is from the Verbal Reasoning section, it is likely that the relationship lies in the number of letters. Since 11 is prime, the number of more cats can be written as 1+1 = 2, and then 1+2 = 3, 2+3 = 5, 3+5 = 8, and 8+5 = 13.\n3. The possible answer choices are (43, 40, 32, 27).

The reasoning says that $n$ should be considered as given, and she gave a total of 30 - $n$ Valentines to her children. Then, the answer of 22 is equivalent to assuming the following:\n- Mrs. Wong has $30 - n$ Valentines\n- Mrs. Wong gave $n$ Valentines to her children\n- Mrs. Wong has $30 - n - n$ Valentines left\n\nThere are two unknowns here ($n$ and $30 - n - n$), and we need to solve for the number of Valentines Mrs. Wong has left. We have two equations and two unknowns, and the solution is $n + 30 - n - n = 22$. This reasoning would only be valid if the two unknowns were independent from one another. However, the given information says that $n$ should be considered as a given quantity.

If Cindy buys 45 stickers, Cindy now has 82+45=127 stickers.\nBut we know Cindy buys 45 more stickers.\nSince Cindy has 105 stickers, I can only think Cindy buys 45 stickers because it is the only way that can make Cindy have 105+45=150 stickers (therefore, she does not buy 45 stickers).\nSince we know Cindy has 150 stickers, there is no chance Cindy has 110 stickers or any stickers that is less than 150 stickers.\nThe only way Cindy can have 150 stickers is that she uses 23 stickers from her 105 stickers and she buys 45 stickers. There is 95.5% chance that Cindy has 127 stickers.\nI also realize I can simply add 105 stickers and 45 stickers and subtract 23 stickers and get 127.

If the model's reasoning can start with subtraction, then it can avoid the mistake.\n\nWe can train the model with the additional training set including the reasoning question.\n\nThe reasoning question can be: Carla has some marbles. She had 53 more marbles, but then she lost 134 marbles. How many marbles does she have now?\n\nAnother question: If Carla had 53 more marbles, but then she bought 134 marbles, how many marbles does she have now?\n\nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: 53 = 134 - x\n\nQ: How would you modify the model to better generalize to questions involving addition and subtraction in different orders?\n\nOne way to modify the model is to use a fixed reasoning schema. For example, the model can first ask how much Carla lost, and then asks how much she had before she bought the marbles. Then we don't need to ask Carla about the reasoning question.\n\n"}

We subtract 20 cents for the pencil, and then 5 cents for the candy. We have 18 cents left.\n\nThe 18 cents answer is the only reasonable answer because of the following reasons. First, there is only 43 cents to start with, so we cannot possibly have any leftover after buying something for 20 cents or more. Second, the only reasonable answer cannot be 15 cents.

How much change will he get?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "He will get 7 dollars.", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nThe problem is to find how much change Adi will get. The dollar sign is $, so he got 100 cents. He paid with a one-dollar bill, which means he gave 100 cents. The pencil cost 35 cents, so he has 100 - 35 = 65 cents left. This is equal to $0.65, so his change is 65 cents.\n\nTo solve this problem, you could first figure out how much Adi gave. Then, you could subtract this amount from 100 cents, which is how much he received. This would give you how much change Adi has.\n\nThe answer is the one you should choose if you want to win. I chose the answer \"He will get 7 dollars.\" because it is correct and it is one of the choices. I'm confident in my answer because I know that it is correct and I can explain why it is correct.\n\nThe reason I chose the answer is because I know that the answer has to be a multiple of 5 because there are only 5 choices to choose from.

First, we can identify the variables in the problem: \"Each glass needs two lemons\" and \"they have 18 lemons.\" We can use these variables to create a proportional relationship between the two variables, which is equivalent to the equation y=2x. We can use this equation to determine the number of glasses that Jane can make with the 18 lemons, by solving for y when x=18. This gives us y=36. We can then use this result to identify which of the answer choices is correct. We can see that 9 is the only answer choice that is a factor of 36, and is therefore a possible number of glasses that Jane can make with the 18 lemons. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is 9 glasses.\n\nQ: Considering"}

This implies that the children are living in a building in the city, which is not necessarily the same as the building where they are eating the cupcakes. This means that the number of boxes of cupcakes given away can be different from the number of boxes of cupcakes left at home. \n\nSo, the answer to the question is 81, which is not correct. The correct answer is actually 0.25%.\n\nThe reason is that the question is asking for the number of boxes of cupcakes given away, which is a different number from the number of boxes of cupcakes left at home. Therefore, the answer of 81 is not correct. The correct answer is actually 0.25%. This is because the number of boxes of cupcakes given away can be any number between 0 and 53, and the probability of the answer being correct is 1/53 = 0.25%."}

{"question": "They also gathered paper to create some star-shaped papier-mache.

The question also explicitly mentions 20 pieces as critical in figuring out the answer. This narrows the possible answers down to 34, 39, 49 and 57. \n\nWith this, we can now reason as follows. Given that 20 pieces are required per star, the problem statement asks us how many stars can be made, and provides the number of paper pieces they have. Let's let n be the number of stars, 20 the number of paper pieces per star, and 680 be the number of paper pieces. Thus, we can reason as follows:\n\n20n = 680\n\nn = 680 / 20 = 34\n\nThus, 34 stars can be made with 680 paper pieces, if each star requires 20 pieces of paper.\n\nSo I reasoned that 34 is the only possible answer.\n\nNote that we can also do this by simply counting how many 20-piece units fit into 680 pieces.

{"question": "Matt had 4 small cans of gold paint.

This gives y = 4, and x = 6. This implies that the total number of stars is 6 x 4 = 24, and the total number of cans is 3 x 4 = 12.\nHowever, since Matt only has 4 cans, the answer cannot be 24. In order to evenly distribute the stars to the 4 cans, there should be 3 stars per can, which gives 12 stars in total.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 12.\n```\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

This leaves 6 cut-outs for 1 card which is not possible. So there can be maximum of 6 cards made with 4 cut-outs each. The remainder is 2 cut-outs (which cannot be used for 1 card).

In that case the answer is `261`, which I feel confident about because if each bowl has only `23` fish and there are `261` bowls, then there must be `261` fish in total. If there were only `260` fish, then the last bowl would have to have `25` fish in it.\n\nBut then I thought maybe there is only one bowl with `23` fish and the critical reasoning step is `261 x 23` to get `5993`.

This shows that a division result has the form of \"remainder\" + \"quotient\". \n\nThe problem asks \"How many nickels\" does Mrs. Hilt use to buy the notebook? \nThe most critical step in reasoning to the possible answer: 26/1 is to understand that this problem is essentially asking the same as asking \"How many $0.05\"?\nIf we have \"How many $0.05\", we can answer the problem.

There are ${}^7C_3$ possible arrangements for the students to ride in the first three consecutive groups and ${}^7C_1$ possible arrangements for the students to ride in the next three consecutive groups.

And \"how many more cartons of berries\" refers to the quantity of blueberries and strawberries that she is missing and needs to buy. The question doesn't specify whether Anita wants to buy blueberries or strawberries. It means that she needs to buy both blueberries and strawberries. It doesn't specify how many berries to buy, which is another problem. However, the problem doesn't specify the price of blueberries and strawberries either.

So there are 2 books left on the bookshelf. If 2 books are green, the other 2 books can be either orange or blue. So there are 3 colors remaining. Therefore, the probability of 2 books being orange and 2 books being blue is 1/2. (This is my reasoning.

One of my main critiques is that you don't explain why 4 is incorrect, which would be the main reasoning needed to get the confidence in your answer. A few more things you can improve:\n    - It would be better to start your answer with something like: \"While I think that the answer is 2, I can also understand the reasoning for 4...\"\n    - It's hard to follow your reasoning because you didn't format it"}

In other words, you are asking if a person is in the school, and the question is asking how many are there in the school.

The answer is about 193, so I choose 192.\nThen, I calculate the confidence level of the answer by using the information in the question.\nSince the answer is a number, the possible answers are 0-193 (193 numbers).\nThen I calculate the probability of each answer being the correct one. The way to calculate the probability is to assume the correct answer is between 0 and 193 (which means the correct answer has 193 possibilities). Therefore, the probability of each answer being the correct answer is 1/193.\nFinally, I get the confidence by summing the probabilities of the numbers up to the given answer. Since the answer is 192, I sum the probabilities of the first 192 numbers. It turns out to be 0.9010296, or 90%.\nI would like to know how you arrive at 90% confidence level."}

However, we cannot put an even number of pieces of chalk in a box, so we must subtract 1 more piece of chalk from the 3,290 pieces to account for the leftover piece.

Now we can eliminate the 18 to 21 by process of elimination. This leaves us with 15 to 18, 18 to 24.\n\nThe first step is to find out how many girls there are compared to the number of boys. Since we know that there are 15 boys, we can divide 18 by 15, and we get 1.2. We know there are more girls than boys, so the ratio of boys to girls is going to be less than 1, meaning that 15 to 18 is incorrect, because 15 to 18 is greater than 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of boys to girls is 18 to 24."}

There are two fractions that equal to 3 : 4, one with a numerator of 120 and the other with a numerator of 80. Since there are two ratios that could be used to fill in the numerator in a ratio of 3:4, we cannot select a particular ratio as the one most likely to be correct. \n\nWe will assume that the ratios of the numbers are equally likely to be correct. As a result, there are six possible correct answers: 0.5, 0.25, 0.75, 0.125, 0.375, and 0.625. The confidence in the correct answer is 50% (6 correct answers/12 possible answers) because the ratios were equally likely to be correct. \n"}

If this pattern continues,. how many cans do you  think Zachary will find on the seventh day?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "27", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation:\n```The above reasoning could be described as 'the first, second, third, and fourth differences of 4, 9, and 14 are equal'. Therefore, the 4th and the 5th differences (not necessarily the difference between the 4th and the 5th number) should be equal, as well. Hence, Zachary would find 10 cans on the 5th day and 12 cans on the 6th day. As a result, he would have found 4 + 9 + 14 + 10 + 12 + 19 = 68 cans on the 6th day and 4 + 9 + 14 + 10 + 12 + 19 + 24 = 92 cans on the 7th day, therefore, the most likely number of cans Zachary would find on the 7th day is 92 and the chance of the answer being 27 is (80-75)/100 = 5/100 = 5%```\n\n\nExplanation:\n```On the first day he found 4 cans.

How long did Elizabeth study altogether?", "correct answer": 60.0, "llm answer": "60 minutes", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "0.8\n\nQ: Which answer is most likely to be incorrect?\n```Incorrect Answer: [choose any one]```\nIncorrect Answer: 5 minutes\n\nQ: How could you check whether your reasoning is correct?\nConsider the following steps:\n1. Suppose Elizabeth studied 0 minutes for her science test, then she will only study 35 minutes for math test.\n2. Since her total studying time should be at least 25 minutes, the minimum total studying time should be 25 minutes.\n3. The maximum total studying time is 60 minutes if she studied 35 minutes for math test and 25 minutes for science test.\n4. So the answer should be between 25 minutes and 60 minutes.\n5. Since only 35 minutes and 60 minutes are in this interval, it is most likely that they are correct answers.\n\nQ: How could you answer the problem more accurately?\nOne strategy could be:\n1. For the given situation, Elizabeth studied 25 minutes for her science test.\n2. Let's try to find out her study time for math test: Let's try 10 minutes for the math test.\n3. If this is correct, we can add the two study times and get her total studying time.\n4. So,"}

In the original statement, it would look like this:\n```27 + x = 62``` \n\n* Solving for x, we find that the answer is 35. Thus, we would have the following statement: ```x = 35```\n\n* Then we go back to our confidence interval. The confidence interval is the probability that our answer will be correct. Since we found our answer using logical reasoning, our confidence level would be the same as it is when we have two equally likely choices. This would be 50%. So our answer would be 50%.\n\nIn summary, we have x = 35 and a 50% confidence level that the answer is correct.\n\nPlease note that the question was about the probability of the 35 answer to be correct. In other words, the question was asking how confident we were that 35 is the answer.

Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis. Dennis has 70 marbles. We need to determine how many marbles Laurie has.\nWe can approach this problem by first determining the number of marbles that Kurt and Dennis have, and then using this information to determine the number of marbles that Laurie has.\nTo do this, we can start by assuming that Kurt has 0 marbles, since he has 45 marbles less than Dennis. We can then add 45 to this number to get 45 marbles for Dennis. Finally, we can subtract 12 from this number to get 33 marbles for Laurie.\nTo be sure of our answer, we can check our work by verifying that the sum of the marbles for all three people adds up to 70 (Dennis' original number of marbles). Since 0 + 45 + 33 = 78, which is equal to 70, we can conclude that our answer of 33 marbles for Laurie is correct.\n"}

How many hours does Hannah practice each week?", "correct answer": 33.0, "llm answer": "8 + 85 = 93", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\nA: First of all, this question is a reasoning question, so you need to understand what \"practice 8 hours every weekend. She practices 17 more hours than that during the week\" implies. That is, the word \"that\" in \"She practices 17 more hours than that during the week\" refers to the 8 hours. The word \"that\" in this case indicates that we should compare the number of hours during the week to the number of hours every weekend. To be more specific, you can say \"the number of hours during the week should be 17 hours greater than the number of hours every weekend.\" The \"than\" in \"17 more hours than that\" indicates that we should compare two numbers here. The \"more\" in \"17 more hours than that\" indicates that the number after it is greater than the number before it. In this case, the number of hours during the week is greater than the number of hours every weekend, which is 8 hours. So we can conclude that the number of hours during the week is 8 + 17, which is 25. Thus, the answer is 8 + 17 = 25.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely"}

But we know that he drove at 40 mph because he arrived at 7:20 am. Therefore, Hanson would have driven 80 miles (100 – 20) in the hour between 6:00 am and 7:00 am and another 20 miles (80 / 4 = 20) between 7:00 am and 7:20 am.

If this pattern continues,. how many carrot cakes will the bakery make in February?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\nPlease use only numerical values for the confidence score (e.g. 0.5 and 1.0 are also acceptable as 50% and 100% respectively)\nExplanation: We use the following formulas to predict the number of cakes the bakery will make in February. The general pattern is the rate at which we produce items. However, we need to consider the increasing amount of items we make. \nrate = 19 + 2/3(21) + 2/3(23) + 2/3(25) = 23.67 items per month\nIn order to predict the number of items the bakery will make in February we just multiply the rate with 1 month.\nrate x time = 23.67 items x 1 month = 23.67 items = 24 items\nSince the bakery can only make a whole number of items the number of cakes the bakery will make in February is 24. Therefore, the answer is 24 cakes."}

To satisfy Jeremy’s requirement, there must be a number that both 90 and 72 can be divided into. This number is the greatest common divisor of 90 and 72, which is 36.\n4.

If it's a whole number, the correct answer is that all 29 coats will go to each box, thus the left over coats is zero.\nThe left over coats are not a fraction, it's just the remain after dividing 29 by 3. So it can only be a number smaller than 3. Now the answer has been narrowed down to the range of 0-2.\nSince the answer cannot be a fraction, then it must be a whole number, and the only option in this range is 1. Since there are three boxes, and each box has one coat less, then each box has 9 coats, and that is not an option, thus the answer is 2."}

(But this is not a strict proof, it's just the best guess I have)\n\nExplanation:\n- The information is useful to narrow down the possible answer. After knowing there are 11 total pieces of pepperoni, it is reasonable to assume that each pizza will not get more than 2 pieces of pepperoni. Therefore, the possible answer can be narrowed down to 3, 6, 9, and 5 1/2.\n- The reasoning process is as follows:\n- After seeing the total number of pepperoni, we need to reason about the minimum number of pepperoni each pizza can have (because of the upper limit of 2). So we divide the total number by the upper limit (2), which is 11 / 2 = 5 1/2.\n- If each pizza has 5 1/2 pieces of pepperoni, there will be 11 pizzas. So the number of pepperoni left over is 11 - 11 = 0.\n- If each pizza"}

How many Lemon Heads does she have left?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "15", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\nIn addition to the provided answer, I think the answer should be 7, because of the following reasoning: \n\nIf there is a total of 78 lemon heads, we can divide by 5 and get an answer of 15. However, that number is not an actual number of lemon heads, because each package is a multiple of 5. For example, if there were 8 lemon heads, it would make sense that there were 2 packages of 5 and 3 individual lemon heads left over. In this case, there would be 15 packages of 5, but it would make more sense to look at the number of individual heads rather than the number of packages of 5. We can subtract out the 15 packages of 5 from the 78 total lemon heads, and get the answer of 63. We then need to subtract 15 because of the fact that there were 15 packages of 5. This gives us the answer of 7 individual lemon heads, which is the most reasonable answer.\n\nMy reasoning is based off of the fact that it is reasonable to subtract out the 15 packages of 5 from the total number of lemon heads.

It follows that the total number of pencils Paige had is 2 + 2 + 15 = 19. Paige has 19 pencils in all. The number of pencils in her backpack is 2. Hence, the number of pencils at home is 19 - 2 = 17. It follows that the difference between the number of pencils in Paige's backpack and at Paige's home is 2 - 17 = -15.```"}
{"question": "A chef had forty-six apples. After making some pies he had fourteen left.

The critical step that I believe is the most important to this question is the comparison of the 46 to the 14. From this comparison, we can see that we must be missing 32 apples. If we were to put all 32 apples back in, then we would be left with 14 + 32 = 46 apples, which was the amount that we originally started with. Now, we can reason as follows to determine the confidence of this answer being the correct one.\n\n1. The first and most obvious piece of evidence that we have is that we have 32 apples missing. We know this for sure, and we are confident in our deduction that we must be missing 32 apples. We can add this evidence as the first piece of evidence to be considered in our reasoning process. \n\n2. The second piece of evidence that we have is that we have 14 apples remaining.

But, I do think that the confidence is too low. I don't know how the question is worded but I assume it is something like: \"What number is it such that if you subtract it from 32, the digits of 32 are interchanged.\" So I assume that this is the definition of the question.\n\nThen the reasoning can go like this: let's look at 32 and 20 as a pair. 20-32 = -12 and 12-20 = -8. We can then make 2 groups of 4 and get 2 groups of 8. These 2 groups are the ones that can be subtracted from 32 to get 20. From this reasoning, we have 2 groups of 4 and 2 groups of 8 that can be subtracted from 32. So the answer is 20.\n\nThe reasoning can be improved by noticing that if you add 20 to 12, you get 32. So, 20+12=32. Thus, the reasoning is: since the digits of 32 are interchanged, then 20-12=8. From this, we know that 20"}

Find the angles of the triangle.", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "80, 48, 52", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nA: Assuming you mean the second angle is 32 degrees less than twice the first angle, the three angles are 120, 80, and 80. 120 + 80 + 80 = 280, which is clearly impossible. In other words, the assumption is wrong, and this is a common error in similar problems. We are left with your original answer, but it doesn't satisfy the conditions. If the second angle is 32 degrees less than three times the first angle and the third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle, we end up with two systems of linear equations to solve: x + y + z = 180 and x + 3x - 32 + 2x - 28 = 180 (we can't use the fact that the second angle is 3x because this is what we are trying to find). Solving the system, we get x = 80, y = 48, and z = 52, which meets the conditions.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

To get the number of new dogwood trees planted today, we subtract the current number of dogwood trees from the total number of dogwood trees in the park. So, new = total - current. From the problem, we know the current number of dogwood trees is 38, and the total number of dogwood trees in the park is 56. So, new = 56 - 38 = 18 dogwood trees planted today."}

She could be making a cake and put in the wrong amount of flour, because that is the question, but she didn't, and the amount of flour she put in was correct for the cake, so she probably put in the right amount, so the cake must be a pound cake, and 4 cups of flour is the correct amount. \n"}

What is her weekly allowance if she ended with eleven dollars ?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "$11", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n- I think the most critical step should be \"washed the family car and earned six dollars\". Because this information is the only information that cannot be deducted from the first sentence. And also, this information is critical to answer this question. If Jessica only spends 1/2 allowance, and earned 6 dollars, then Jessica will have an extra $1. That means her weekly allowance is $6 + $1 = $7. And if Jessica had an extra $1, then $11-6-1=$4 for movies. Hence, her allowance = 4.5. \n"}
{"question": "Melanie had 276 dollars to spend on 9 books. After buying them she had 15 dollars. How much did each book cost ?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "30", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: Consider the following reasoning step: ```The number of books is 9.``` Then: ```The number of books (n) x each book cost (x) = 276 (276 dollars is the initial amount)```, i.e. ```n*x=276```. This is a known equation with two unknowns: n and x. To solve it we can substitute n=9 as given and obtain ```x=276/9=30.88```, that is: ```9 books cost 30.88 dollars```. However we know that Melanie has now only 15 dollars remaining after spending 276 dollars. This means that she would need to spend less than 276 dollars to have 15 dollars remaining. So she probably bought 9 books, each costing 30 dollars, because ```9*30=270 < 276``` and ```9*30-15=270-15=255 > 15```, that is: ```270 - 15 = 255```. This reasoning is not completely correct because it is impossible to spend exactly 255 dollars. Melanie has only 15 dollars remaining, but it is possible that the books she bought were priced at 271 dollars in total, and she had some extra"}
{"question": "The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is one hundred twenty-three.

The smallest number is the middle number because odd numbers go 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. We do not need to find the two smallest odd numbers because we only need to find one of the smallest odd numbers. The number 39 is an odd number, so it is one of the smallest odd numbers and it is the smallest number. That is because the smallest odd number has to be the middle number because if we subtract the smallest number from the middle number, the difference is 0 and the middle number minus the largest number is 0 as well.

Also, considering there are 6 candy bars and 4 drinks, if we add 4 drinks and 1 candy, we get 5 things, which is also divisible by 5, implying 4 drinks and 5 candy bars.

Find the number.", "correct answer": 53.0, "llm answer": "91", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\nThe critical reasoning step 2x = 18 is to tell us that the larger digit must be at least 8, since the sum of the two digits is 8. So the number can not be a single digit. In fact the possible answers would be 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90. We can eliminate all except 9, 18, 81. And this reasoning step helps to eliminate 81.\nThe reason that 81 can be eliminated is that the number 18, the number formed by reversing the digits, is the largest single digit number difference between 9 and 81. So the difference 18 between a two digit number and the number formed by reversing its digits can not be greater than 18, which is the case for 9.\n\nConfidence: 30%\n\nExplanation:\nI don't know how the question is presented.\nThere are no limits to how big the numbers can be (2-digit, 3-digit,...), nor what value x can be.\nI don't know how many answers are expected.\nI don't know how the question is expected to be answered.\n\nConfidence: "}

Please explain briefly and write a brief answer to justify it.\n\n```Answer:\nIt is easier to work backward to the answer than to use the above method.  In the above method, you need to think about the number in the critical step. For example, if the number of the critical step is n, then you can figure out the cost of the cow by 115+n, and then you can calculate the cost of the calf by 990-115-n.  Thus, you need to determine two numbers n and n. In comparison, when working backward, you do not need to do any calculation at all. Instead, you can simply apply the following reasoning. Since the man paid 8 times more for the cow than for the calf, if you spend the money you had for the cow on the calf, you would have the same amount of money as you did for the cow. Thus, if you spend 115 on the calf, you would have 990-115=$875 left over, but you do not have any leftover. Hence, 115 must be the cost of the cow.\n```\n\n# Problem Formulation\nGiven the critical reasoning step as additional"}

How many more bottles will she need to buy on the last day?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nThis is an interesting question, where there are many ways to get to the wrong answer. The fact that Robin needed exactly 9 bottles means that she drank 9 bottles each day, leaving 6+17 = 23 bottles left over, and the last day she will need 9-23 = -14 bottles. This is why people tend to choose wrong answer -4 because they just think the question asks the number she needs to buy in the last day. In this case, the critical thinking step (bottles left over: 6+17) should be highlighted to avoid these people getting into this trap. \n\nHowever, even with this critical thinking step, there are still a few cases where people might come to the wrong answer, such as not noticing that the last day she needs to buy 9 bottles instead of 8 bottles (because if she only needs 8 bottles in the last day, there would be 6+8 = 14 bottles left over, which is 5 more than 9, and so the correct answer would be 5 instead of -4). In this case, people who are thinking critically might be misled to choose answer -4 instead of answer -5.\n\nQ: Considering this critical reasoning step as"}

{"question": "A container can hold four orange slices.

In the second step, reason that the result is the number of containers needed. For example, four slices could be put into a container; so the result tells how many containers are needed to put in 329 slices.\nIn the reasoning step, a critical reasoning step is shown. In this step, the author of the problem tries to make the problem solvers think by giving some crucial information. In this step, dividing 329 by 4 (i.e. 82) is used to calculate the number of containers needed.\nWe can reason that the answer is 82 with high confidence. First, 82 is the only option that is a multiple of 4. This tells us that 82 is the number of containers needed, and thus the answer of the problem. Second, since each container can hold 4 slices, 4 x 82 = 328. This tells us that 82 is the correct answer, as the total slices is 329. These two pieces of evidence strongly support that 82 is the correct answer. However, 82 is not the only option that meets these two criteria. Therefore, there is"}

You could only find the correct answer to the question if you correctly apply the \"divide\" operator, since the question asks for how many friends she can invite.  However, even if someone has the correct understanding of how to divide, they might still make an error in performing the division (e.g., they may forget to carry the 1).  I estimate that the probability of someone answering correctly is around 0.4%, since you only need to apply the division operator correctly, and you only need to apply it correctly 9 times in the division process.  If you want to estimate the probability that someone answers correctly, you can also consider that most of the answer choices have a large gap in their values, and so the probability that a person chooses the right answer is even less (and I would estimate to be around 0.1% or less).  However, I still think the question is very difficult, because I'm not sure how one would estimate the probability that someone selects the right answer."}

After this step, the possible answer is a bit more likely (i.e., the probability of the answer to be incorrect is smaller). So the confidence becomes 0.5-0.2=0.3.

By adding the critical reasoning step, we change the possible answer from 50% to 40% which is a very small change. We can also see that we only have 50% of being correct at first, and now it is still 50%. We do not know if the critical reasoning step is correct. If we are correct, we know nothing about the correctness of our first answer. If we are incorrect, we know nothing about the correctness of the first answer.

The following is my reasoning:\n1. We know that Paige used 3 of her pencils.\n2. We know that Paige now has 91 pencils.\n3. Therefore, we know Paige must have lost 3 pencils.\n4. Therefore, we know Paige must have started with 94 pencils (3 pencils lost, plus 91 pencils).\n5. Paige lost 3 pencils because she used 3 pencils.\n6. Therefore, Paige must have started with 3×3=9 pencils (we subtract 3 because she used 3, and then multiply by 3 because 9 is the amount of pencils she could have used up to 3 times.)\n7. 94–9=85 (We subtract 9 from 94 because we know that Paige must have had 9 pencils to start.)\n8. Therefore, Paige had 85 pencils, plus the 3 pencils she started with, which is 88.\n9. 88 is divisible by 3, and therefore 88/3=29, which means that Paige must have had 29 pencils to begin with.\n"}

If 42 were hiding, then they wouldn't be visible in the cage. Maybe the question should instead be how many snakes are visible?\n\n#### Posted by: 3 months ago\n\nThe question asks how many snakes are not hiding. \"Not hiding\" is a logical opposite of \"hiding\", so if a snake is hiding it is not not hiding. It follows that, since 42 snakes are hiding, the remaining 68-42 = 26 snakes are not hiding.\n\n#### Posted by: 3 months ago\n\nI agree with the solution.

What is the combined weight of all three boxes?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "18 pounds", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation: For the Jerry weighing problem, the weights are 13, 5, and 11, respectively. The critical step is the combined weight. When we reason backwards, we can see that the answer must be 18 pounds (13 + 5 = 18). We can use our prior beliefs about the critical step to reason to this answer.\nWe first reason that the combined weight should be within one of the largest weights (because we must add one of the weights to the other two). The largest weight is 11 pounds, so the combined weight must be either 10, 11, 12, or 13 pounds. Because the combined weight is not a multiple of 2, we reason that it cannot be 12 pounds. Thus, we have narrowed our range down to either 10, 11, or 13 pounds.\nWe then reason that the combined weight must be closer to the largest weight than to the smallest weight. The largest weight is 11 pounds, so the combined weight must be 10 or 11 pounds.\nCombining these two reasons, we conclude that the combined weight must be either 10 or 11 pounds. Because we know that the combined weight is the sum of the three weights, and because"}

If the customers were all seated around one big table, then they would have all tipped the same. And if 51 people all tipped the waiter, it would be a lot of money.\n\nHowever, I believe that the question is asking about different customers, so the answer is 2. The answer seems likely because a tip is usually given, so the chances of 49 people giving a tip is low. The waiter has 49 customers not giving him a tip.

So the maximum number of snack bags should be 6 granola bars. In this question, Serena wants to create snack bags that are identical. So each snack bag should contain one granola bar and one piece of dried fruit. Therefore, the greatest number of snack bags Serena can make is 6/7. However, it is also possible that Serena might want to create snack bags that are different. In this case, the maximum number of snack bags Serena can make is 10 pieces of dried fruit.

But the question says that the number of red flyers equals the number of blue flyers, so the red flyers she gave out cannot be 130, instead it is 130-x (x is the number of red flyers that she gave out to the clothing stores), x should be a multiple of 10 so that 10*13 equals the number of blue flyers she gave out to restaurants, thus x should be 30 or 40, either way, 130-x cannot equal to 200, hence the answer should be 20.\n\nI think the answer should be 20 but 22 is not that unreasonable.\n\nQ: According to this information, how likely is the answer to be 20?

How likely is the above answer to be correct?\nConfidence: 100%\n\n# Reasoning Strategy:\n## 1. Use reasoning to find possible answer\nThe two clocks will chime together when their time differences are multiples of 15 * 25 = 375. (This is because if the difference is a multiple of 375, 15 hours will elapse before the two clocks chime together again.) Therefore, the 25 possible answer is 375.\n\n## 2. Use reasoning to eliminate other answers\nIt is clear that 30, 75, 150, and 600 are all multiples of 15 * 25 = 375. (These are because 75 = 3 * 15 * 25, 150 = 6 * 15 * 25, 30 = 2 * 15 * 25, and 600 = 8 * 15 * 25). In particular, 75 is the smallest possible answer that fits these characteristics.\n\n## 3.

By doing this, we can find the maximum width of each strip.\nFirst, we know that the width of each strip is equal to the length of the shorter piece of cloth. In this case, the shorter piece of cloth is 72 inches wide. So, we can divide the width of the longer piece of cloth (90 inches) by 72 inches to find the maximum width of each strip. This gives us 18 inches as the maximum width of each strip.\nFinally, by knowing that both pieces of cloth have to be cut into strips of equal width, we can conclude that the answer is 18 inches.\n\nAnswer:"}

Instead it probably takes 2 ounces of cheese to make a burrito and 5 ounces of cheese to make a taco.\nThis is my reasoning: \n1) Solid stuff (cheese, not air) will fit in a container, so if it takes 4 ounces of cheese to make a burrito it will take up space inside a burrito, 32 ounces will take up much more space than the burrito can hold.\n2) Since the question wants a taco to be made out of the leftover cheese, it must be more than a burrito and less than the 32 ounces of cheese. 9 ounces for a taco is much smaller than 32 ounces, and the question does not ask for 9 ounces but instead asks for one taco.

In this case, the confidence of being right is 100%.\nIf we were to be asked for the amount of tips Amy made, the answer options are all integers, so even though the most logical answer is to use the amount Amy earns, it could be that the tip is an integer value and is the difference between the answer options. So the confidence of being right is 50%."}

But 42 is not listed as the possible answer.)\n\nExplanation: Youtube is the world's largest video streaming site. Each day, the average viewer watches two videos with an average of seven minutes each. In addition, viewers also watch three minutes of ads. So, how many minutes total do people spend on Youtube each day? This is a very good example of a word problem that is difficult to solve if you have to read it, translate it, and then do math. This one has a little bit of trickery in it, though. If you are familiar with this type of problem, you might have noticed that there is a way to take the numbers and manipulate them to arrive at the right answer. That is the method I use here. First, there are two videos watched with an average of seven minutes each. To simplify this calculation, I am going to multiply both numbers by two to get two minutes each. Next, I'm going to add those two minutes together to get four minutes of video time. I now have four minutes"}

How many balloons did he give away total?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nQ: Why did you choose the given confidence level?\n\nReason: In the first sentence, \"clown gave away\" and \"gave away\" are two synonymous expressions. I suppose that the writer of the question didn't know these two expressions are synonymous, and thus intended to say \"the clown gave away total 14 balloons\" instead of \"the clown gave away total eleven balloons\". The difference between \"eleven\" and \"14\" is that the former is one of the 20 numbers, while the latter is the sum of \"11\" and \"3\". Thus, I think the author of the question just made a small mistake. If we consider this reasoning as additional information, then I think we can infer that the correct answer is 14 with 20% probability.\n\nQ: What is the maximum probability that you can assign to the correct answer?\n\nReason: I think it is 20%.

So, we do not know if the party has enough cupcakes. We need to buy more cupcakes to make sure that each person gets two cupcakes. To get the number of cupcakes to buy, we need to take the number of people at the party (9), multiply by the number of cupcakes each person gets (2), and then add the cupcakes already there. 9 x 2 = 18, and 18 + 6 = 24. The answer is 24.\n```Answer: The most"}

That means if Anne gives the same amount of Sweettarts to 3 people, she has to divide her Sweettarts equally to 3 equal parts. Thus, there must be 15 / 3 = 5 Sweettarts for each person.\n\nHowever, we know that the correct answer is: Each person ate 5. But because there is not enough information to conclude that Anne gave each person 5, there is some uncertainty in our reasoning process. \n\nWe give 50% chance that this is correct, and 50% chance that this is not correct. \nIn this way, we can conclude that our confidence in the answer Each person ate 5 is only 50% and there is a 50% chance that it is incorrect."}

Thus, 45 - left cannot be larger than 45, so you cannot assume the leftover is larger than the number of people, 18. It is possible for a person to eat the same amount of candy as the leftover, but Sean has eaten the leftover. So the question becomes, what are Sean's friends eating. To make Sean's friends eat more candy than Sean, they have to eat more than leftover, and this means that the leftover is not enough for Sean to eat.\n\nI understand Sean is eating candies and 45-left cannot be larger than 45, but can Sean eat the leftover?\nLet's assume he did, so 45-left = 18. I don't understand what is Sean's friends eating more candies than Sean. It's quite possible Sean's friends ate less candies, but Sean ate the leftover.\n\nIn general, you should treat Sean as one person. In the question, we know Sean's friends eat the same amount of candy. That's what the problem is saying: Sean's friends ate equal amounts of candy. The key here is Sean ate the leftover."}

{"question": "Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. If she shares the crayons among 30 friends,. how many crayons does each friend get?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "21", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nIn order to make the prediction, you must think about the following reasoning steps: \nFirst: if each friend gets 21 crayons, then the total amount of crayons will be equal to 21 * 30 = 630. Is this number equal to the total amount of crayons that Denise has? \nSecond: if each friend gets less than 21 crayons, then the total amount of crayons will be less than 21 * 30 = 630. Is this number less than the total amount of crayons that Denise has? \nThird: if each friend gets more than 21 crayons, then the total amount of crayons will be more than 21 * 30 = 630. Is this number more than the total amount of crayons that Denise has? \nThen you must think about the numerical possibility of each friend getting more, the same, or less than 21 crayons, and the numerical possibility of the total amount of crayons being more, the same, or less than 630. \n\nExplanation:\nFirst: Denise has 210 crayons.

Therefore each group has 7 Skittles.\nTherefore the correct answer is: 7 Skittles in each group.\n\n```Confidence: 50%```\n---\nSolution\nThe most important step is that we know that 11 x 7 = 77.\n\nSince there are 77 groups, each group is a multiple of 77.  We can think of how 77 factors.  The only factor of 11 is 11.  So 11 is not an option.  However, the only other factor of 77 is 7.  Since we know that the answer has to be a multiple of 11 and 7, 7 has to be the number of skittles in each group.  \n\n```Confidence: 40%```"}

So each group has 3300/75 bananas, which is 44.\nIf you divide the 3300 bananas by the number of bananas in each group, you get 75. 75 is not equal to 5. I think that the problem asks the bananas per group, so 3300 bananas are organized into 75 groups, meaning each group has 3300/75 bananas, which is 44. That makes sense because Janice has 5 crayons, which are not mentioned in the problem, but it makes sense that she only has 5 crayons.\nIf you divide the 3300 bananas by the number of bananas in each group, you get 75. 75 is not equal to 5.
