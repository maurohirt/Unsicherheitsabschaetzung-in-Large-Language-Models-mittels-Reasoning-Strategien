{"question": "Adam has five more apples than Jackie. Jackie has nine apples. How many apples does Adam have?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n```Explanation: We only have five pieces of information: Jackie has 9 apples, Adam has five more apples than Jackie, and we want to know how many apples Adam has. The key to finding the answer is to set up an equation that expresses the relationship between Adam's apples and Jackie's apples. Let A and J represent the number of apples that Adam and Jackie have, respectively. Since Adam has five more apples than Jackie, we can write A = J + 5. Since we know that Jackie has 9 apples, we can substitute J = 9 into the equation. This gives A = 9 + 5, so A = 14. Thus, Adam has 14 apples. This reasoning is correct if we assume that Jackie and Adam have the same number of apples. This assumption is reasonable because the question is asking how many apples Adam has, and we know that Jackie has 9 apples.```"}

The number of peaches Steven has is 13. Subtract 6 from 13, you get 7. Since 7 is the next number to 6, this satisfies the requirement of \"6 less\". The keyword 13 peaches is equivalent to 13. The 13 peaches are not 6 less than anything, since it is given that 6 peaches is less than 13 peaches. 13 - 6 = 7.\n\nQ: What is wrong with the answer and reasoning above?\nThis reasoning seems to be correct, it just has some confusing and unecessary information. In particular, 13 - 6 = 7, and the key information is that Steven has 13 peaches and Jake has 6 fewer peaches.

How many muffins does first grade bake in all? is a math question about the math problem:\n```(18+20+17)/3``` is the correct answer.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows: If each class in first grade bakes the same number of muffins, then the number of muffins baked by each class is 3(18 + 20 + 17) / 3, which equals 55.

How many pink cookies did she make?", "correct answer": 50.0, "llm answer": "50", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\n# Solution\nThis is a simple addition/subtraction problem. To make it easier, let's start by defining the total number of pink cookies to be the unknown number, which we can call it $x$.\n> So we have: **pink cookies** = **total cookies** - **red cookies** = 86 - 36 = 50\n\n# Answer to the above question\nYes, this is the correct answer."}

How many more flew up to the tree?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 0.92, "probing response": "92%\n\n### Why this is the answer\nWe use `birds` and `tree` as the topic, and fly as the event that happens. So in total there are 29 birds sitting on the tree and some more fly up to the tree. The question is how many birds flew up to the tree, so we should find the change in the number of birds in the tree, which is the `change in the number of birds`. Then it says there are 42 birds in the tree, so we subtract 29 from 42 to get 13, so 13 flew up to the tree, hence answer 13 is correct.\n"}

The keyword here is'multiples of'. We want to find a number that is the multiple of 3 as well as 12. It is possible to find such number using divisibility rules. The divisibility rule for 3 is that we can check the sum of the digits in the number, if it is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. Thus we can find the numbers between 24 and 27 that are divisible by 3, they are 24, 27, 30, 33 and 36. The next step is to check which one of these numbers is also a multiple of 12. This can be done by finding a number which is divisible by both 12 and 3. For example, 12 is divisible by both 12 and 3, but 15 is divisible by neither 12 nor 3.

One is the question is in the context of counting. The other is the question is in the context of addition. In the context of addition, we first count the number of eggs (39 + 29 = 68). Then consider the bacon is a subset of eggs. So the total number of breakfast ingredients (39 + 29) is equal to the number of eggs (68). Then we just need to add the bacon back.

{"question": "Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution.

There is only one question in this question set.\n\n## Discussion\nWhen we try to tackle this question, we need to focus on the keywords in the given information.\nWe are interested in the total area of land and the area of land cleaned by Lizzie's group. So we start with the keywords that can tell us the value of them: `900` and `250`.\nWe know that the cleaned area by Lizzie's group is 250, and that there is a total of 900 square feet of land to be cleaned. So the total area minus the area cleaned by Lizzie's group should be the area cleaned by the other group. That gives us the keywords `900 - 250 = 650`.\nWith the cleaned area by the other group, we could add it to the cleaned area by Lizzie's group and we should get the total area of land cleaned, that is `250 + 650 = 900`.\nNow the area cleaned by the other group is the remaining area after Lizzie's group cleaned `250` square feet of land, which is"}

So, if the drinks cost 0 dollars, that would make the total money spent 0, which is not true. Thus, we know drinks cost more than 0 dollars.\nWe know the money spent on food was $268.00 and that money spent on utensils was $118.00. So, if we can subtract $268.00 and $118.00, then the remainder must be the money spent on drinks. $560.00-$268.00-$118.00 = $174.00, which makes drinks cost $174.00, which makes perfect sense since we know that drinks cost more than 0 dollars.\n\nAnswer: $174.00"}

There are 7 colors in the rainbow, so there are 7 sets of cupcakes. Then, we need to know how many cupcakes there are in each set. Mona prepared rainbow colored cupcakes, so there are 7 colors, and she prepared 6 cupcakes for each color. Therefore, there are 6 cupcakes in each set. Now, we can count the total number of cupcakes that Mona prepared. Since there are 7 sets of cupcakes, and there are 6 cupcakes in each set, we can multiply 6 by 7 to get 42. 7 sets of 6 = 42.

It can also be represented as 10!/(1! 9!), and if there are multiple choices (for example, 5 and 10 in this case), you can simply write the product of all numbers above 5 (and 9 in this case) as a shortcut to represent the factorial of (5+1).```\n\n```For example, the answer to this question can be shortened to 50 balls x 1 day/2 balls, i.e., 25 balls/2 balls = 12.5 days, which can also be represented as 1! 10!/(2! 8!) = 12.5 days.```\n\n```The number of balls can be changed.

But the information that 9 houses is the key information, 9 houses must be an even number, and it must distribute equally so there can be no left behind. 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 is 24, it cannot be evenly divided by 9. So the left behind will be 3, 9 - 6 = 3, 24 + 3 = 27, 119 - 27 = 106. I have considered the answer with high confidence, the keywords helped me to see the answer as a whole and think out of the box, I think I can only have 90% confidence. If someone told me it's a wrong answer, I would think more about the problem but still think it's 90% confident."}

Therefore, we can divide 100 miles (which is the distance to Grandma's house) by 20 miles per gallon to find out how many gallons of gas are needed to get to Grandma's house.

Third, since there are only 3 answers which start with the same 4 digits, the 4-digit answer has the highest chance to be the correct answer (among the 10 candidates). Fourth, the possible answer is 7 digits long, and so is the correct answer. Fifth, there are only 2 answers which are 7 digits long, one of which is the possible answer.

The simplest way is to calculate the division, which is 40 divided by 7, or 5.714285. In order to express this fraction as a decimal, we need to multiply the dividend by 10^2. This results in a quotient of 57/16, or 19/8.\nThe division could also be expressed as 7/40, which could be expressed as 5/28. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 7. This would give us the simplified fraction of 5/4. The reciprocal of this fraction would be 4/5, which would be the answer of 19/8. Another way to get this answer would be to divide the original dividend by 2 and then multiply it by 3. This would give you the answer of 19/8.\nTo find the quotient of the division of 40/7, we would have to first convert it to a decimal, which is 5.714285. This can be simplified by dividing the dividend by the divisor, which would give us the quotient of 7/40. This can be simplified by dividing both the numerator"}

However, we do not know which book she read. Since there is no other information to distinguish which book she read, we can assume that she read each book in full (this is the 2nd reason).

There are 1230 passengers. That means there are 1230 passengers/48 passengers, that is 25.25. 25 and a quarter of a passenger. It is rounded to 25, so there are 25 passengers. There are 48 passengers, so 48 * 25 - 1230 passengers, that is 1230. 48 * 25 = 1200. So, 48 passengers * 25 passengers - 1230 passengers = 48 * 25 - 1230 = 1200 - 1230 = -30 = -30 = 30 passengers that are not on the bus. If you count correctly, you get -30 as the result. So, you subtract 30 from 48 passengers, which is 48 passengers - 30 passengers = 18 passengers that are not on the bus. That is not right because that is more than the 30 passengers that are not on the bus.

{"question": "If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day,. how many days does he need to fix the watches?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "Tom needs 13 days", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nExplanation: We know from the given problem that Tom fixes 12 watches every day. Also, there are 158 watches, so it is clear that he cannot fix 158 watches in a single day, hence the given answer seems correct. The only thing which is left is the number of days required to fix 158 watches. For this, if we divide 158 by 12, then we get remainder as 2 which means 12 watches were already fixed the previous day. Hence, there are still 2 watches left to fix which can be done in the next day.\n```Therefore, 158 watches can be fixed in 13 days.```\nTherefore, Tom needs 13 days to fix all the watches.\n"}

This is more than what he can fix on any given day (12 watches), and so he needs to spread the fixings across multiple days. This means that the last day cannot be the only day on which he will fix watches, so he must fix at least one watch on a day before the last day, and at least one watch on a day after the last day. If the only watch he fixed was on the last day, there would not be any day with multiple watches fixed, which contradicts the statement that Tom needs to fix 158 watches. This means that he must fix more than one watch on the last day, and since he cannot fix more than 12 watches on any given day, the last day must have 11 watches fixed, making a total of 11 + 1 = 12 watches fixed on the last day.\n"}

And to put 4 into 5 rows, you have to take it off 5 times, which is 5*4 = 20. So 44/5 = 8 and 44 - 9*5 = 20 + 9 - 5 = 24. Then if we continue this argument, it should be 24 + 11 - 5 = 30, which is not what we want.\nBut when you consider 4/5 = 0 with remainder 4, then 4 - 5 = -1.

The 4 yard pieces are quite a bit longer than the 1 yard pieces, which means that the difference in the number of pieces will be minimized if we cut a large number of 1 yard pieces. \n\nIn order to minimize the difference in number of pieces, we need to cut the fewest number of 1 yard pieces possible. In order to do this, we need to cut the most number of 4 yard pieces possible. This means that the number of 1 yard pieces must be smaller than the number of 4 yard pieces. Let x be the number of 1 yard pieces. In order to minimize the difference, the number of 1 yard pieces must be x=1.

The first step is to compute how many lollipops each kid will get if each kid gets an equal number of lollipops, that is, dividing the total number of lollipops by the number of kids. Here the answer key says the number is 15.48. This means each kid will get a fraction of a lollipop and thus we need one more lollipop to make sure that each kid gets at least one lollipop. \n\nAnother way to solve this problem is to compute the total number of lollipops that each kid gets if each kid gets an equal number of lollipops and then compute how many lollipops each kid will get if there are one more lollipop to share among all the kids.

The only solution is that all students get 1 cup each and at least 1 more cup remains.\nTo distribute 218 students 1 cup each we need 218 cups, and to distribute one more cup to 218 students, we need one more cup. So a total of 218+1=219 cups is required.

{"question": "Ralph has a photo album with 50 pages. He has 26 pictures of wild animals. Ralph's friend, Derrick, has 34 pictures of wild animals. How many fewer pictures of wild animals does Ralph have?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\nI know it's not correct. But my reasoning is that if there are only 50 pages in the album, and Derrick has 34 pictures, Derrick would have to have at least two pages in his album with two pictures. Therefore Ralph can't have 30 pictures, because each of his 50 pages would need to have a picture. So 26 is the correct answer. However this reasoning does not work because Derrick's album could have multiple pages with one picture (so Ralph could still have 30). The keyword '4 more pictures' made me think Derrick could not have a page with two pictures, but it's not given that Derrick has more pictures, and so this information is not useful. I don't know if this is the right way to do the reasoning. But this reasoning would only work if '4 less for Ralph' was a keyword instead. \n\nQ: How long did it take you to answer this question?

How many more pairs of shoes must they sell?", "correct answer": 41.0, "llm answer": "41", "confidence": 0.96, "probing response": "96%\n\n### Why?\nAs I understand, we are given that Lou's shoes needs to sell 80 pairs of shoes each month. We also know that they sold 39 pairs of shoes last week (27+12) and they need to sell more pairs of shoes. \nSo the answer should be 80-39. If we assume that this is the correct answer, we can evaluate the possible answers in the question. For example, the 41 is the one that is closest to the answer we found. \nSo we can have the following reasoning:\n```If 39 is the amount of shoes they sold last week, then there are 80-(39+12)=80-51=29 shoes they need to sell more.```\n\nHowever, if you think of the reasoning in terms of keywords, we have the following keywords: ```80, 39, 27, 12, 41, 29```.\nWe can see that the keywords are ordered as follows: ```80-39, 80-(27+12), 80-(27+12)=80-39, 41, 29```.\nAnd we know that ```80-39=41```.

That is, Andy's initial number of baseball cards was 31, and he then received some more baseball cards, increasing his number of cards by a certain amount. To find the correct answer, we need to use the given information to determine the number of baseball cards that Andy received from his father. \nSince Andy's final number of baseball cards was 50, we can use the formula for addition to calculate the number of baseball cards that Andy received. We know that adding two numbers gives the sum of the numbers, which in this case is 50. Since Andy's initial number of baseball cards was 31, we can subtract 31 from 50 to find the number of baseball cards that Andy received from his father. This gives us 19.

{"question": "Bridget wants to win the giant stuffed panda bear. She needs a total of 75 points to get it. Bridget already scored 35 points at the penny pitch booth. She scored 18 more points on her next try. How many more points does Bridget need?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "58", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "0.99\nReasoning: [answer:58] \"Bridget needs a total of 75 points\" indicates this is a summing problem; we know she has already gotten 35 and another 18, so we need to add 18 and 35 together and we will have the final score, which will then be compared to 75. [answer:58] We are told that she needs 75 points, and she already got 35 and then another 18, which means we add 18 and 35 to find her total score, which would be 53. [answer:58] If we were to take 75 and subtract 35 we will find that she needs 40 points. Adding 18 to 40 we will get 58. [answer:58] We know that Bridget already scored 35 points and 18 more points, so we can add 35 and 18 to get 53. Then if we add 53 and 35 we will find the final score is 88. 88 - 75 = 13. Since Bridget needs 75 points, she should need another 75 - 35 - 18 = 22 more points. 58 - 22 = "}

We need to find out how many hours Hannah practices every week.\n5. So we get 25 + 8 = 33.\n6.

If we suppose that children and adults sit randomly, then we can calculate the probability of all children and adults sitting in the same seats. That is, if we suppose that every adult has an 1/81 probability of sitting on each seat, then the probability of all adults and children sitting in the same seats is P(1/81)^81 = 9.32*10^-43, which is extremely small. So the probability that no adults and children sit in the same seats should be extremely high.\n(2) As the total number of people is 81, there are only 81 possible combinations of people sitting in the same seats. By the above argument, there is only one possible combination, which is that there is no combination of children and adults sitting in the same seats. Therefore, the probability of all 81 people sitting in different seats is 1/81^81=1/9.32*10^43, which is extremely small. Since there are so many empty seats (95-81=14) and the probability of all 81 people sitting in"}

How many marbles did Alvin have then?", "correct answer": 64.0, "llm answer": "64", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation: I am going to reason the answer as follows:\n\n1. The first sentence states that Alvin had 57 marbles. It doesn't explicitly say \"at first\", so he could've added or lost marbles. So let's call this number A. Then A=57.\n\n2. The second sentence states that Alvin lost 18 marbles during the first game. Since I didn't know the number of marbles he started with, let's call the number he had \"before the first game\" B. And the number of marbles he had after the first game C. Then C=B-18.\n\n3. The third sentence states that he won 25 marbles during the second game. Since I know the number of marbles he had after the first game, let's call the number of marbles he had before the second game D. And the number of marbles he had after the second game E. Then E=D+25.\n\n4. Now we have enough equations to solve for the unknowns: A=57, B=C+18, and D=E-25. Since A=B, that means 57=C+18, and 39=C. We can substitute 39 for C into the equation D"}

But we believe it should be good enough to evaluate the answer. If you would like to submit additional keywords and your reasoning process, you can contact me.\n\n---\n\nI also provided additional reasoning in the following sections.\n\n### Reasoning for answer 62\n\nThe question is asking for how many campers went rowing in all. Since the problem has two sentences with different time, it is likely that we should find an answer that represents a sum of the two.\n\nI have tried different methods to find an answer that matches the sum, such as 35 + 27 and 60 + 2, and found that the only answer is 62.\n\n### How I make the decision?\n\nBased on my experience, it is easier to solve the problems that contain two different sets of information if the information is in form of two numbers and they should be added together. Thus, I guess the correct answer should be a sum of the two numbers.\n\nHowever, the key to solve this question is how to guess the two numbers. Since there is no numbers and only descriptions, we have to figure out which number should represent which set of information. After reading several times, I think it should be 35 and 27,"}

If this pattern continues, how many flowers will Derek pick from the sixth bush?\n\nWe can see that Derek is picking a different number of flowers from each bush.

How many coins does she have?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85.00%\nExplanation: There are multiple ways to reason to the possible answer. First of all, we can notice that there are 2 choices among 6 coins (quarters or dimes). If Kira only had dimes, then there would be at most 2 dimes, which contradicts the question. If Kira only had quarters, then there would be at least 5 quarters, which is a contradiction too. Thus, Kira has both quarters and dimes, and we can count from the options. If we start from 5 quarters, then there are 2 coins left, which must be 2 dimes, a contradiction. If we start from 4 quarters, then there are 3 coins left, which must be 3 dimes. However, then the number of dimes is less than the number of quarters, a contradiction. We continue the process, and it seems that 6 is the only choice that will not lead to any contradiction.\n"}

If most children attend camp, and the population is small, then the answer must be less than 564,237. If most children attend camp, and the population is large, then the answer must be greater than 564,237.

Since there are a total of 8 stickers between the two boys, we can also say that the ratio is 3 to 5 for every 8 stickers. Let's call the ratio for 8 stickers `r` and so the ratio of Ted's and David's stickers can be expressed as `r` to `8-r`. Now we're told that David used 8 stickers. This means that David's stickers can be expressed as 8 times the value of `r`. Therefore, David's stickers can be expressed as `8*r` and `8-8*r` is Ted's stickers. We're asked the ratio of Ted's stickers to David's stickers and this can be represented as the ratio of `8-8*r` to `8*r`. We know from above that `8*r` is equal to `8-r` and so the ratio becomes `8-8*r` to `8-r`. We can simplify this ratio by first distributing `8` to `8-r` and so"}

What is the smallest number of songs each band could have performed?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "54 songs", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation:\nQ: In this question, the two bands are playing different numbers of songs in a set but are able to perform the same number of songs together. It turns out that this is only possible if the number of songs played by one band is divisible by the other band's number of songs. For example, if Amanda's band played 18 songs and Sadie's band played 9 songs, then each band would be able to play 2 sets of 9 songs and 1 set of 18 songs, for a total of 18 songs for each band. It is also worth noting that 54 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 2 and 9. In fact, any number that is divisible by 2 and 9 will also be divisible by both 2 and 9.

What is the smallest number of butterflies that she could have seen?", "correct answer": 748.0, "llm answer": "753", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: The keyword “identical number of two types of insects” is actually redundant. The keyword “always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17” indicates that Kristen is counting. So we need to count all the butterflies and all the fireflies. Kristen should have counted at least 44 × 17 butterflies, and 17 fireflies. The smallest number she should have counted is 44 × 17 – 17 = 753.\n\n```[Reasoning for 753 being correct: 753 is the smallest number of butterflies that Kristen could have seen. We know this because Kristen always seems to observe butterflies in groups of 44 and fireflies in groups of 17. Kristen could have counted at least 44 × 17 butterflies, and 17 fireflies. The smallest number she should have counted is 44 × 17 – 17 = 753. If Kristen had seen 753 butterflies, she would not have had any left over to put into another group of 44, and she would have had 17 left over fireflies.

Since she packs equal quantities of each, we can set up a system of equations.\n\nLet x be the number of pretzels and y be the number of crackers.\n\nWe know that 5 pretzels equals 7 crackers, so we can set up the equation: 5x = 7y.\n\nNow we can say that y is the smallest integer that satisfies the equation 5x = 7y. To find this smallest integer, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get x = 7y/5.\n\nWe want to find the smallest integer value of y that makes this equation true, so we can set y to 1 and check the result.

The result is 10, meaning that X + 2X/3 + 6 = 10. I can also rewrite this as (3X + 18)/3 = 10, and finally, 3X + 18 = 30. If I subtract 18 from both sides, I get 3X = 12, which gives X = 4. I can then plug in X = 4 back into the expression to get 2(4)/3 + 6, which simplifies to 8/3 + 6 = 10. Since the expression in the statement is equivalent to 10, the correct answer is 6.\n- The reasoning above could be summarized by considering the keywords as additional information.

Then, we can compute the larger number, using the given relationship: 6 times the smaller number is the larger number. So, the larger number is 6 times 7. Finally, we have 7-6=1 as the smaller number and 7+6=13 as the larger number. Then, if the smaller number is larger than the difference (70), we should try a smaller number, e.g., 6. Then, we will get 6-6=0 as the smaller number and 6+6=12 as the larger number. Thus, we can guess the answer is 0 and 12. We can check this answer by checking whether the difference is correct (12-0=12), and the relationship holds (6 times 0 is 0). This is the most common strategy. The confidence score of this answer is 96%. However, if the larger number is 6 times the smaller number, we can consider the smaller number first. Then, the larger number is"}

Let the width of the building be \"x\". The length of the building is then \"x + 7\" because it's 7 ft more than the width. The perimeter of the building is 98 ft, so the total length around the building is 98 ft. The length of the building plus the length of the two sides is equal to 98 ft, so we can make an equation: 2(x + 7) + 2x = 98. This means the length of the building plus the two sides of the width equals 98. 2(x + 7) + 2x = 98 means 2x + 14 + 2x = 98, so 4x + 14 = 98. We can now subtract 14 from both sides: 4x + 14 = 98 becomes 4x = 84, and then divide both sides by 4: 4x = 84 becomes x = 21. This means the width is 21 ft, and the length of the building is 21 ft + 7 ft, which is 28 ft"}

How much money did Fred make washing cars ?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11 dollars", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: To solve this question we can use the subtraction of numbers as follows: The first given statement says that Fred had 46 dollars and Jason had 13 dollars. Thus Fred had 46 dollars and Jason had 13 dollars. The second given statement says that Fred washed cars over the weekend and now has 57 dollars. Thus the amount Fred has now is 57 dollars. The last statement says that Jason now has 13 dollars. Thus Jason still has 13 dollars and his amount has not changed. From these two statements we know that Fred has 57 dollars and Jason has 13 dollars. So to find the additional information we need to subtract 46 from 57 which is 11 dollars. The answer is 11 dollars.\n"}

(I might add it in the future for the sake of sharing the process.)\n```\nExplanation: The problem wants us to know how much each person should pay at the end, so we have to know the total of the bill and the number of people.\n\nSince the dessert has not been included in the bill, Mary, Nancy, and Fred paid in total 33 dollars.\n\nThe total cost should be at least 3 x 33 = 99.\n\nThe bill is most likely to be a whole number, so the total should be 99 dollars, and each person should pay 33 dollars. But the problem asks for the total of the bill, not each person's payment.\n\nIf each person paid a little less (such as 32.5), then the total of the bill will also be less. So the answer cannot be the minimum. Therefore, the answer has to be"}

How many cards did Fred start with ?", "correct answer": 47.0, "llm answer": "13", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n```\nReasoning: Fred has 5 new cards.

There are now 26 cards left in Fred's collection. Fred's collection now has 26 - 10 = 16 cards. 16 is the number of cards the dog ate, meaning the dog ate half of 16 cards, or 8 cards.

If the total number of heaps is 72,. how many marbles does each have?", "correct answer": 336.0, "llm answer": "216 marbles", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe reason I am so confident is as follows:\n1. The question is asking about total number of marbles in the beginning, which is 480. The possible answers only give us two options: either one or another. So, I can rule out the answer with less information first. In this case, the answer with fewer marbles would be better. This is because the marbles are arranged in the same amount for both boys, which means they both lose fewer marbles than the answer with more marbles. So, the answer with 216 marbles is more likely to be correct.\n2. The question tells us that one boy arranges the marbles into 6-marble heaps and another into 9-marble heaps, with 72 in total. This means we can divide the total number of marbles into two, one boy having 6/9=6x9=54, and another having 72-54=18. This means the total number of marbles is 72-54=18, which is exactly the same as the total number of marbles in the beginning. This means the answer with 216 marbles is more likely to be correct.\n3. The question tells us that the total number"}

Thus, the reasoning is:\n- 'a' is 10 more than 'b' => a = b + 10\n- Sum of two numbers is 52 => a + b = 52\n=> (b + 10) + b = 52\n=> 2b = 42\n=> b = 21\n=> a = b + 10 = 31\nThis is indeed correct, and has 80% confidence.\n\nQ: How does the system arrive at the above answer (21 and 31)?\nThe reasoning above follows from a combination of keywords and numerical constraints. The keywords provide the equation `a + b = 52` and the equation `a = b + 10`, which we combine to yield the two equations:\n1. `a + b = 52`\n2. `2b + 10 = 52`.\nWe can solve these equations by taking their difference to cancel out one of the `b` variables:\n`a + b = 52`\n- `- (2b + 10 = 52)` = `a - 2b = -42`\nAdding these equations to cancel the `a"}

If one side is L, another is L+8. The other two are W and W+8. Thus 2(L+W) = 56. Therefore, L + W = 28 and W = 28 - L. We know L is smaller than W. But what else can we use? We know 8 is smaller than L and we know 20 is smaller than W. This seems like we have enough information to guess an answer. It is possible L=10 and W=18, but we see that this is not correct, thus the confidence that the possible answer is correct is only 20%.\n"}

For example, one may also take the combination of '1st + 3rd + 3rd' as the sum of the three consecutive integers. But it should not affect the answer as the sum must be 24.

How wide is the garden?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "15 meters", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```\nReasoning:\n\nWe first notice that the question tells us the perimeter (80 meters) and one side (25 meters) of a rectangle, so the other side can be easily calculated as 2 * 25 = 50 meters. The reason it is 2 * 25 instead of just 25 is that 25 meters is the length of one side of the rectangle, but 50 meters is the total length of the garden, which is the length of both sides added together.\n\nKnowing that the perimeter of a rectangle is 80 meters and the length of one side is 25 meters, we can use the formula to calculate the other side. We know the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length of one side plus 2 times the width, which means we can set up an equation like this:\n\n2 * 25 + 2 * w = 80\n\nWe then solve the equation for w to get the answer.

Therefore, the side is 12 meters. This also means the area of the garden is 12^2 = 144.\nSince the pond is a square, the side of the pond is sqrt(20) = 2sqrt(5) meters. Then the area of the pond is 4*2sqrt(5)^2 = 40*sqrt(5) square meters.\nSo the area of the garden that is not taken up by the pond is 144-40*sqrt(5) = 144 - 80.95 = 63.05 square meters.\n```"}

What is its width?", "correct answer": 20.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n```Reasoning: [Your reasoning in words]```\nReasoning: We need to figure out the width of a rectangle. Since 6/5 = 1.2, we know that we are dealing with a ratio of 1.2, and thus the possible answer has a width that is 20% less than the length. Therefore, we look for the number that is 20% less than 24. 4 is the answer that satisfies this.\n\nQ: Is this correct?\nCorrect: True\n```Reasoning: [Your reasoning in words]```\nReasoning: 6 times 4 is 24, and we also know that 6 is 20% larger than 5, so 4 must be 20% less than 6.

I found length to be 40 and width 10, but the question is asking for width to be 10 inches. So, I thought 40 would be the length. Then, I used 1-3-1-1 and got perimeter to be 50. I thought width to be 10 inches, so 40 inches must be the length. \n```\n\nQ: What is the reason for choosing this answer over the other answers?\nThe reason for selecting 50 as the answer is that 50 is the perimeter of the rectangular cutting board, which is 10 inches wide. This means that the length of the cutting board is equal to the perimeter divided by the width, which in this case is 50 divided by 10, resulting in 5.\nThis reasoning can be explained in terms of the relationship between the perimeter and the length of a rectangular cutting board. The perimeter is equal to the sum of all the sides of the rectangle, and the length of the board is equal to one of the sides of the rectangle. Since the cutting board is 10 inches wide, the length"}

But the question asks for 9 playlists. So that means that the 372 songs can be evenly put into 4 playlists and then there is an additional playlist with 4 songs in it. 4 songs in 9 playlists is 4/9 or 44%. But then I realized that we can't put 44% as the confidence, because that means Megan would have 44% songs that would be leftover. The question asks for how many songs would be leftover, not what percentage of songs would be leftover. Megan could have 0 songs leftover, 1 songs leftover, 2 songs leftover, 3 songs leftover, etc.  44% was the percentage of songs that would be leftover if she could equally put the songs into 4 playlists.

However, 1408 is a bit too big to be the answer for a 3 minutes question so we have to multiply the 1408 with a smaller number until we get to the answer, in this case, we divide 1408 by 60 to get 23.33 minutes and we multiply it by 7 again until we get the 196 shirts, which is 7 × 23.33 × 60 = 196 × 60 = 196 × 1 minutes = 196 minutes. But that's the time it takes to make 196 shirts not the time it takes to make one shirt, and so we need to divide 196 by 7 to get 28 which is the answer for this question, which is 7 × 28 × 60 = 196 × 60 = 196 × 1 minutes = 196 minutes / 7 = 28 minutes which is the correct answer.\n\nQ: Now with 6 as the answer, how likely is it correct?

If we were to divide 459 centimeters by 9 equal pieces, the result will be the length of each piece. However, since the question asked to cut the string into 9 equal pieces, I think there's a difference between dividing and cutting. In fact, I believe that when cutting, we always leave a little bit of the string in the end, so I decided to use a number slightly higher than 459 centimeters to calculate, which would be 460 centimeters. Then, 460 centimeters divided by 9 equals 50 centimeters. Therefore, the answer is 50 centimeters. (1/5)"}

If six of the apples weren't ripe yet,. how many good apples did they pick?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: \nThe problem mentions the total number of apples and the number of apples that are not ready. The question is asking how many ripe apples there are. \nThere are two ways to solve this problem.\nThe first one is to subtract 6 from 14. \nThe second one is to take 14 as 100% and 6 as 50% as the apples that are not ready are 50% of the total apples. Therefore the ripe apples will be 50% of the apples that are not ready and 100% of the total apples. \nIn this way, 6 is 50% of 14 which means 50% is 50% of 100% (as the question gives the total number of apples as 14) therefore 100% is 100% of the apples that are not ready, which means there are 14 ripe apples. \nThis is true because (100/100) - (50/100) = 50/100 = 0.5 x 14 = 7.\n```\nIn the first way, subtracting 6 from 14 gives us 8 ripe apples. \nThe second way gives us 14 ripe apples, which are not possible because there are"}

I can't eliminate that possibility yet.\n* Let's try to eliminate the possibility that there are 8 bedrooms on the ground floor. The architect built a house with ten bedrooms. That means he put up the house intentionally. That implies that the architect has a reason for that number of bedrooms. That reason could be that he needed 8 bedrooms to rent on the ground floor and 2 on the second floor. But then I could have used that information to solve the problem. Therefore, there has to be another reason. This is the best I can do without more information. "}

I will explain my reasoning: First, it is clear from the question that all the information about the waiter and his customers is encoded in a finite amount of information, as the question itself can be written down in a finite amount of information. This suggests that the possible answer must somehow be able to capture the full information of the waiter and his customers, and hence be also finite. \n\nHowever, the question does not provide any more information than just \"After some left he still had three customers.\" There are different ways to interpret this statement. For example, after 3 customers left, there were still three customers, or after 14 customers left, there were still three customers. This leads to the possibility that the 3 in the possible answer could refer to 3 customers who have left or the 3 customers who are still with the waiter.\n\nTo further narrow down the possible answer, we can consider the first few lines of the question: \"A waiter had fourteen customers. After some left he still had three customers. How many customers left?\" The first line \"A waiter had"}

From the equation $15 - x = 9$, we can subtract $15$ from both sides to get $-x = -6$, and then multiply both sides by $-1$ to get $x = 6$. $x$ represents the number of pounds of candy that Will gave to Haley, so $6$ is the correct answer."}

I see that he wants to compare the 2 new crayons to the total crayons. However, it is hard to see the relationship between the total crayons and the used crayons. I see that the broken crayons is a comparison with used crayons. I will assume that these are all crayons that were used up. Then, what would Roger's answer be if I take out the broken crayons? I see 2 and 4 new and used crayons respectively. I can compare 2 to 4. If I take out 4 crayons from 8 crayons, I will have 4 left. Now we have 2 and 4 crayons left, which means 6 crayons in total. I can see 6 in the list, so I think this is the answer. 55%"}

Camryn practiced both the trumpet and the flute today. How many days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day? To answer this question, we can use modular arithmetic and prime factorization. First, we can simplify the question by writing it as \"how many days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day?\". This gives us the answer in terms of the original problem. Next, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the question even further. Since Camryn practices the trumpet every 11th day and the flute every 3rd day, we can simplify the question to \"how many days until Camryn practices the trumpet and flute again in the same day?\". This gives us the answer in terms of the original problem. Now, we can use prime factorization to simplify the question even further.

That's simply 26 choose 26, which is 26! / (26! * 0!) = 1. However, because we are dealing with pairs of headphones, we need to make sure we don't have 13 pairs of headphones and just 1 pair of music players or 13 music players and just 1 pair of headphones.\nSo we need to subtract that, which is 13 choose 13, 13! / (13! * 0!) = 1.

What is the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nReasoning: If the question is: \"How many trees can be in a row?\", it doesn't matter whether it is a row of oak trees or a row of pine trees. There are two types of trees, and we want to see which option gives us the greatest number of trees, so we should first compare the number of oak trees with the number of pine trees. Since 54 is greater than 27, it is likely that there is more oak trees, so if we want to compare the greatest number of trees, we should focus on the number of oak trees. Since 54 can be divided by 9, the number 9 is a good option. And 9*6 = 54, the number of trees in one row is the greatest. This reasoning is not perfect, but it gives a 99% confidence. The perfect reasoning can be: \"Abe would like to plant the trees in rows that all have the same number of trees and are made up of only one type of tree\", so the oak trees should be put in one row and the pine trees should be put in the other row. There are 9 oak trees and 9 pine trees in each row. In total, there are 18 rows and"}
{"question": "Your local radio station is having their yearly music player and concert ticket giveaway. For one minute, every 5th caller will win a music player and every 7th caller will win concert tickets. You were just the first caller to win both a music player and concert tickets!. What number caller were you?", "correct answer": 35.0, "llm answer": "2(number) + 1", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nSolution: In this task, the keyword 5th caller implies that in the first 5 calls, there will be 0 music player winners. The keyword 7th caller implies that in the first 7 calls, there will be 1 concert ticket winners. So the music player and the concert ticket should be given on calls 6 and 8 respectively. Thus the number of callers should be 2*5-1=9. So you are the second caller.\nThis problem is an example of inverse proportion. A problem about inverse proportion can be solved by either setting up an equation or by using the idea of rate.\nIn this problem, the keyword 5th caller implies that 1/5 of the total number of callers have won a music player. The keyword 7th caller implies that 1/7 of the total number of callers have won a concert ticket. So 1/5x = 1 and 1/7x = 1. From here, x=5*7=35. So the total number of callers is 35.\nThen 1/5x = 1 implies that the number of music player winners is 5, and 1/7x = 1 implies that the"}

What is the greatest number of snack bags that Destiny can make?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "18 bags", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n```Explanation: Since Destiny received a box of 18 candy bars, she will have to divide that by 2 in order to have 9 candy bars per bag. This means that she has 9 candy bars to put in the bags and 18 bags she can fill up with those candy bars. Since she has a pack of 12 cookies to share out in addition to the 18 candy bars, she will also need to divide the 12 cookies by 2 to have 6 cookies per bag. Since there are 6 cookies in one pack, she will need to make 2 packs. This means she has 12 cookies to put in the bags and 6 bags to fill up with those cookies. She can have 9 bags filled with candy bars and 6 bags filled with cookies, so 15 bags total. However, we are asked for the greatest number of snack bags that Destiny can make, so we must calculate what is greater: 18 bags or 15 bags? Since Destiny has 18 bags to start with and only needs 15 bags, she can only fill 15 bags.

The clocks are going together in 75 minutes. But why is it 75 and not 0 or 15 or 25 or 40 or 50? The reason is that the 50 minutes after 25 minutes is not 50 and not 25. It means that there must be a new minute after 50. So it is 75.\n\n## Question: 2\n**Question:** In how many minutes will two clocks chime together if one chimes every 12 minutes and the other chimes every 10 minutes?

It is obvious that the number of sweets they can divide into each tray must be a factor of 62. I can eliminate 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12 and 15, because if each tray has these numbers of sweets, we have to leave some sweets in Peter's or Tim's bag and the problem cannot be completed. After elimination, 16 and 31 are the two possible correct answers left. '31' cannot be correct because we need to leave 22 sweets in Tim's bag when we put 16 sweets in each tray.

How many birds did the pet store have total?", "correct answer": 77.0, "llm answer": "77", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nThe answer is 77. The keyword '64' says that the total number of birds was 64, and the keyword '13' says that 13 of them didn't talk. Therefore, the total number of birds must be 77 (64 + 13).\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to use a Venn diagram. The keyword '64' means that there were 64 birds, and the keyword '13' means that there were 13 birds that didn't talk. Therefore, the total number of birds must be 77 (64 + 13).\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that the question gives us two pieces of information: the number of birds that talked and the number of birds that didn't talk. We can combine these two pieces of information to get the total number of birds."}

Here is the step-by-step solution: 1. We can use the associative property of addition to solve this problem. The associative property states that when we add three or more numbers, it doesn’t matter which two numbers we add first, as long as the same two numbers are added each time. For example, if we have 3 + 4 + 5, we can add 3 and 4 first to get 7, and then add 5 to get 12. Alternatively, we can add 4 and 5 first to get 9, and then add 3 to get 12. The answer is the same either way. 2. We can apply the associative property to the expression in the problem. Let’s start by adding 5 and 7: (5 + 7) + 9 = 12 + 9 = 21 3. Next, we can add 5 and 9: 5 + (7 + 9) = 5 + 16 = 21 Again, the answer is the same either way, so we can conclude that the answer to the original problem is 21.\n    - ### The"}

If he sold some decks but didn't sell all, the decks left will be greater than 0 and lesser than 5. That means, the possible range of decks left is [0, 5] as he started with 5 decks.\n\nThe question asked how much money he earned. We are going to find out how much money he earned using the possible number of decks left. We know that if he sold all his decks, he will earn 2 * 5 = 10 dollars. That means, the possible range of money earned will be [0, 10].\n\nLet's move to the possible answer 8 dollars.\n - Possible decks left: 3\n - Possible money earned: 2"}
{"question": "A chef needs to cook 12 potatoes. He has already cooked 6. If each potato takes 6 minutes to cook,. how long will it take him to cook the rest?", "correct answer": 36.0, "llm answer": "42", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\nReasoning: We know that for each potato the cook needs 6 minutes to finish. We know that he has already finished cooking 6 potatoes, so he is left with 6 more potatoes to finish. For each of these potatoes, he needs 6 minutes, thus he needs 6*6=36 minutes to finish. Thus, the total time required for 12 potatoes is 6*6+6*6=36+36=72 minutes. The answer provided as correct is 42 minutes, thus we know that the answer is not correct. We could check our answer by checking what is the total time for 4 potatoes. 4 potatoes takes 4*6=24 minutes, thus the total time for 12 potatoes is 12*6=72 minutes, which matches our answer. Since our answer is not the same as the answer provided, and we could verify that it is correct, we can assume with high confidence that the answer provided is not correct."}

You should explain the reasoning process that led you to your conclusion. ```\n\n```[Please also provide any additional reasoning if the keywords provided during the reasoning question was not enough for you to reach a conclusion]```\n\nAnswer: The Girl Scout cookie case is a problem that can be solved by finding the remainder of a division problem. The remainder is found by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number and seeing what is left. In this case, the smaller number is 12, and the larger number is 31. When 31 is subtracted from 12, there is a remainder of 7. This means that there will be 7 boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes that will not be packed to a case.\n\nSolution: \n\nWe can use the Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. The Remainder Theorem states that when a polynomial is divided by a monomial, the remainder is equal to the value of the polynomial evaluated at the root of the monomial. In this case, we can say that \n\n```x^{12} - 31 = (x-7)(x+4)(x-5)(x+"}

Since the problem asks for the number of bottle caps that must go in each box and there are 60 boxes and 60 bottle caps. 60/60=1.\n\nIf the answer is correct, I think that the reasoning is not the best because we do not know what the bottle caps are. We can only see that there is a box and we can assume that the bottle caps must be the same since the problem mentions that there are 60 bottle caps.\n\nThe reasoning in my answer is:\nAssuming that the number of bottle caps must be equal to the number of boxes, the number of bottle caps is 60.\n\nThe reasoning in my answer is:\nAssuming that the number of bottle caps must be equal to the number of boxes, the number of bottle caps is 60.\n\nMy reasoning is:\nI don't know the answer since we don't know what bottle caps are.\n\nMy reasoning is:\nI don't know the answer since we don't know what bottle caps are.\n\nI think that the answer is 60 and not 1.

This is not an integer.\n- So each friend will get a fraction of cookies. It should be like (X/Y) * 1802/34, where X is the number of cookies each friend gets, and Y is the number of friends. But Y is always 1, so (X/Y) * 1802/34 = 1802/34. Since there is only one friend, the above equation cannot be correct.\n- So each friend will get (X/Y) * 1802/34 = (X/Y) * 53.0294117647059 cookies, and Y cannot be 1.\n\nThe above process of reasoning to the possible answer is too long, so the probability that I make mistakes is too high.

If he shares the eggs among 8 friends,. how many eggs does each friend get?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\n## Reasoning\nFirst we notice that the eggs and candies are 2 different things. We have to figure out how many of each thing to give to 8 people.\nNow there are 2 candies, so we need to think about how we are going to split these 2 things among 8 friends.\nIf you have 2 candies and you want to split them evenly among 8 friends, then each friend will get 1/4 of a candy. But 1/4 is too small of a fraction, so you can round it up to 1/2 of a candy.\nSo each friend gets 1/2 of a candy. Now we don't know how many eggs each friend gets.\nSo we need to think about how many eggs to give to 8 people, so we can figure out how many eggs each friend gets.\nSince there are 16 eggs, and 8 people, each person will get 16/8 eggs.\n16/8 is the same as 2. Since we rounded up 1/4 to 1/2 for the candy, we will round up 2 eggs to 3 eggs.\nSo each friend gets 3 eggs."}
