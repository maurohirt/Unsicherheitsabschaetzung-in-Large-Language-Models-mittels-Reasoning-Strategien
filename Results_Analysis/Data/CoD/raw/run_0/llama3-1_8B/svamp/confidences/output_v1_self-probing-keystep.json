Considering the total number of children riding on the bus is 43, and the number of children left on the bus is 21, the number of children getting off at the bus stop must be 22, or 24. Since the question says \"some children got off\", it must be 22. The total of children remaining must be 21, or the sum of the number of children getting on and getting off must be 43, which is the total number of children.

Let's name this event 1.\n\nAfter the school year, he still has 457 erasers, but only 523 crayons left.

I can't really tell if I'm doing this right, but I'm going with 100% confidence. Since the machine can make 2 shirts a minute, 8 shirts means it worked for 4 minutes. I see no reason to doubt that. 4 minutes worked for one day, and 8 minutes worked for another, so I'm going with the average of the two days being the 8.5 minutes. I hope that helps.\n\n1. I think it's 75%. It seems more reasonable to assume the machine is capable of the same output every time (or at least every day), so 8 shirts in a day is equivalent to 4 minutes of work, which means that the machine took 4 minutes to make the 8 shirts on the previous day. Then, the current day, the machine took another 8 minutes to make 8 shirts, which means it spent a total of 12 minutes on the machine. The question asked about \"today\", so it's not including the time that the machine spent working on the previous day. It only asks for the time spent today, so the answer would be 8 minutes."}

This is an important assumption we need to make. Let's say she cut x flowers from her flower garden, x can be any number. Let's see how many flowers are in the vase after the cut: 3 orchids and 16 + x - 3 roses, i.e. x + 13 roses.\nSo we can conclude: x = 13 - 3 = 10. Therefore, the number of orchids in the vase after the cut is 7.\nHence the correct answer is 4.```"}

First, I find it difficult to determine the probability of regular soda to be 83 bottles. It is not too easy to guess and I guess it has equal possibility with other regular soda numbers. Second, the problem is that this question has two numbers for regular soda. One is regular soda bottles = 83 + regular soda bottles - diet soda bottles = 83 + 79. This is very misleading. If I only see this reasoning step, I will be confident in 83 as the correct answer. However, the correct reasoning step is the second one, regular soda bottles = regular soda bottles + 79.

How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?", "correct answer": 184.0, "llm answer": "184", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\nThis problem is a simple story problem. The question asks us to reason about the number of cakes that baker made. The problem also tells us a few facts about the baker.\n    - The baker made 144 cakes.\n    - The baker sold 71 of those 144 cakes.\n    - The baker made 111 more cakes.\nThere are multiple ways to solve this problem. One way to solve it is to find the difference of the number of cakes made by the baker and the number of cakes sold. We can find the difference by subtracting the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made:\n$$144-71=73$$\nSo the number of cakes made minus the number of cakes sold is 73. The number of cakes made is the total number of cakes the baker made. So the question asks us to find the difference between the total number of cakes and the number of cakes sold.\nIn the story, we are told that the baker made 111 more cakes. This tells us that the total number of cakes the baker made is 111 plus the number of cakes sold. We know the number of cakes sold, so we can substitute 71 in for the number of cakes sold in our equation:\n$$Total \\ cakes ="}

{"question": "Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries.

How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "29", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation: It can be easy to overthink these problems. This problem boils down to the initial situation being \"3 bird families living near the mountain.\" After \"26 new bird families came to live near the mountain,\" we know that there are now \"3 + 26 = 29\" bird families near the mountain. There are no additional clues that the question might be trying to trick us with, so we know that we should look to the possible answer choices with a \"29\" answer in them.\n\nI'll answer the question based on the reasoning I gave above. In other words, I'll just use my gut on this question. I have 50% confidence that the answer is \"29.\" I don't think there is a trick here. It's just a basic critical reasoning problem, and I don't think that the question writer is trying to make it more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nTo explain the reasoning, let's try the other answers. Let's say that the answer is \"27.\" But in that case, there were originally only 2 families at the mountain. If 26 families come to the mountain, we would have 2+26=28 families. That's not what the question is asking, so \"27\""}

How much did his dad's strawberries weigh?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12 pounds", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nSolution: The first problem is that we don’t have any information about the total number of strawberries. However, I believe the answer is still 12 pounds. This can be justified by assuming the total number of strawberries to be 50 pounds, with 24 pounds of which picked by Marco and 3 pounds picked by Marco later. This means the remaining 23 pounds were picked by Marco’s dad. Now, since Marco loses 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, it implies that Marco loses 9/50th of his own strawberries, or 3/50th of the total strawberries, which implies Marco’s dad’s remaining strawberries will be 23-3/50th = 19 pounds. Hence the answer is 12 pounds.\n\nExplanation of above solution: Assuming the total number of strawberries to be 50 pounds, with 24 pounds of which picked by Marco and 3 pounds picked by Marco later. This means the remaining 23 pounds were picked by Marco’s dad.

The problem states that there are 38 bird families living near the mountain, and out of these families, 94 families fly away to Asia, and 47 fly away to Africa.

We can also use the word \"average\" if we are talking about a seat.\n\nWe are looking for a value that would be the number of people per seat when the Ferris wheel has 4 seats and can hold 16 people. \n\nThe number of people per seat is a division: \n\nNumber of people / Number of seats = People per seat\n\nThe Ferris wheel can hold 16 people and has 4 seats. \n\nNumber of people / Number of seats = 16 / 4 = 4\n\nPeople per seat = 4\n\n```People on each seat: 16 ÷ 4```\n\n\n\nTherefore, there are 4 people on each seat.\n\nI hope this is clear.

There were no additional action figures to add so he had to buy more books. The number of books he started with was 2 not 1 and 1 is not the next step in the series. It is 2. There is no possible way he can buy only 1 book. The next step has to be 3 or more and 3 is 1 more than 2.

To correctly answer this question, one needs to determine the initial number of bottle caps, which is obtained by subtracting the initial number of bottle caps (29) from the initial number of wrappers (82). There are 2 types of reasoning: one is to figure out the critical reasoning step (CRT), which can be applied to any type of problem, while the other is to answer the question (QA), which is problem-dependent.\n\n```Example for CRT:\nCRT: initial bottle caps = initial wrappers - initial bottle caps\nCRT is a general critical reasoning that applies to any type of problem.``` \n\n```Example for QA:\nQA: 42 bottle caps - 29 bottle caps = 13 bottle caps\nThe CRT can be applied to this problem to obtain the initial number of bottle caps, which is 29.```\n\nCRT: bottle caps initially: 82 - 29\n\nQA: 42 bottle caps - 29 bottle caps = 13 bottle caps\n\n```The most important reasoning step in this question is to figure out the initial number of bottle caps.

If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends. How many cakes did each person eat?\nIf we use reasoning, we can get the answer that each person ate 15 cakes and 14 crackers. Let’s examine the critical step in reasoning to this answer.\nFirst, we can split the number of crackers into two groups as two persons equally share:\n$$29\\div2=14.5$$\nIt is obvious that the division of 29 by 2 cannot give an integer result. We could also reason with the cakes in the same way:\n$$30\\div2=15$$\nThe two steps show the critical step in reasoning to the answer of each person eating 15 cakes and 14 crackers. The key to reasoning correctly in the two steps is the division by 2 which cannot give an integer result. With the knowledge of the number 14.5, we can use it as an assumption for further reasoning.\nTo show the correctness of the answer of each person eating 15 cakes and 14 crackers, the key point is to find whether the total"}

How many more cups of flour does she need to add?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nThe first thing you can notice is that the answer should be in the form of \"an integer\". This gives you a strong cue that the question must be a division problem and not any multiplication. There is only one way to achieve such an answer from a division problem - when the quotient is an integer.\n\nAnother thing that stands out is that 5/9 is approximately 0.56. The ratio of sugar to flour, then, is about 6. If the answer is 3, this means that Mary had added 3 cups of sugar (or twice the amount that she should have) in comparison to the amount of flour that she should have. While this could have happened, there is no clear reason to be 100% certain that this is the case.\n\nI would thus rate the likelihood of the answer as 60%."}

That is 8 - 10 is the same as 19 - 61, or 61 - 19. So we are looking at 'the difference between 19 and 61 is 42 and therefore we have 42 more movies than books'. But that is not true. The difference between 8 and 10 is 2 while the difference between 19 and 61 is 42. There is no way 61 - 19 = 42, it is just not the same. The only time the difference will be the same, is if there are 8 movies and 19 books, and 8 + 19 = 27. Then it is true that 8 - 10 = 2 and 19 - 8 = 11 and the difference is 2.\n"}

Then he ate 36 more. He also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. He cannot eat a piece of candy then eat a piece of chocolate and then eat a piece of candy again, nor eat a piece of chocolate and eat a piece of candy and eat a piece of chocolate again. It can only be 74 - 16 = 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate, otherwise we will end up with more candy than chocolate pieces eaten."}

First, there are 569 girls in the school. Secondly, there are 236 boys in the school. Next, there are 569 - 236 = 333 more girls than boys in the school.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Jake has 11 peaches and 24 apples. To determine how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we can subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches, which would give us 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, Steven has 1 more peach than apple.\n\nThe reason why I think the answer is incorrect:\nThe answer does not consider the additional information about the difference between peaches and apples. While it is true that Jake has 11 peaches and 24 apples, and that Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples, the question asks us to determine how many more peaches than apples Steven has. Subtracting the number of apples from the number of peaches results in 1, which is not the correct answer."}

How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "35", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nReasoning: The problem states 49 families left near the mountain. 59 flew away and 24 arrived. If the total number of families were constant, then we would have 49-59 = -10 families. However, that would imply that there were 49-59+24 = -14 families left near the mountain. Therefore the total number of families cannot be constant. If we assume that the number of families flying away is constant, then we can assume that the new birds arriving are part of the old bird families that flew away.

What is the cost of each t-shirt?", "correct answer": 43.0, "llm answer": "x=45", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nExplanation:\nIf the price is x, then the amount of profit per shirt is $ 215 - 5x. If the price is x=45, then the profit per shirt is 215-5(45) = $25. This means that, if x=45, then all shirts would have made a profit of $25, meaning that the shirts must be priced at 45. Therefore, x=45 is the correct answer."}

Please read the answer choices again.\nIn this case, we want to know the number of marbles Ed has more than Doug. So, instead of doing 45 - 11, we should be doing 45 + 10 - 11. If we consider the answer choice 16, this would be the reasoning we should take, which would then give us 34 as the answer. (Note that this is not the answer of this question. This is just to illustrate how we reason.)\nI see that 24 is actually the answer, so that should not be picked up as an obvious one.\nI see that 20 is not likely the answer as well since we would not subtract 11 if Ed has 20 marbles less than Doug.

Since they are 1218 ft below the ground, the depth of the cave must be greater than 1218 ft. Thus, they have to travel greater than 369 ft to get to the end of the cave. Only 20 ft is an invalid answer.\n2. Since they travel at speed of 17 ft/min, the time it takes them to travel the rest of the cave must be greater than 369/17 min.

We know that 76 is more than 48. This gives us a lower bound of the answer. We can't do any better because we don't know Katie's friend's number of old games. Therefore, we can deduce that the answer must be between 48 and 76, so we take the lower bound as the answer.\n\nMy reasoning is simple, but my confidence is not very high because of the possibility that I'm missing some other information.

If we subtract 2 apples from the 7 apples that Rachel picked, then we get 5 apples which means there were 5 apples on the tree before Rachel picked the apples. If we subtract 2 apples from the 5 apples, then we get 3 apples which means there were 3 apples on the tree before Rachel picked the apples. If we subtract 2 apples from the 3 apples, then we get 1 apple which means there was 1 apple on the tree before Rachel picked the apples. Thus, if we subtract 2 from the number of apples that Rachel picked, then we get the number of apples that were there before Rachel picked the apples.

I hope this will help students to build their reasoning habits in reading and thinking. \n\nQ: How did you identify the critical step?\nI have learned the most critical reasoning step by carefully analyzing the reasoning process of the answer explanation. I think there are some principles I have learned from the analysis: The most critical step is the step which if changed would result in the most significant different reasoning outcome. \nFor example, if the reasoning outcome of the answer explanation is 2x+3>7 and the step that if changed would result in the most significant different reasoning outcome is 2x+3>6, then this step is the most critical step of the reasoning process in this answer explanation. \n\nQ: What other steps in reasoning are important to consider when making a confident judgement?\nIt's difficult to answer this question.

{"question": "If you have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies. How many cookies does each bag have?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Reasoning:```This question is about the number of cookies in each bag and the total number of cookies. We first have to make sure that the total number of cookies in each bag is correct. We can check this by multiplying the number of cookies in each bag with the number of bags. 2*7=14 which is the number of total cookies. In addition, we have to make sure that the total number of cookies in the bags are also the same with the number of cookies in each bag. To confirm this, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags. 14/7=2 which is the number of cookies in each bag. Therefore, the possible answer of 2 cookies in each bag is most likely to be correct. \n```Reasoning:``` The given information is that there are 14 cookies in total, and 7 bags having equal number of cookies. In order to find the number of cookies in each bag, we can use the division method. Since the total number of cookies is 14, and the number of bags is 7, we can divide 14 by 7 to get 2.

But I’m not sure your confidence level is correct.\nThink about this step: Faye was placing her pencils and crayons into 7 rows with 36 pencils and 30 crayons in each row.\nHow did the word “pencils” in the sentence affect the reasoning? What does the 36 in 36 pencils refer to?\nAlso, how did the word “crayons” in the sentence affect the reasoning? What does the 30 in 30 crayons refer to?\n@jazzyjazzy, can you say why you’re confident the answer is 294?\n\nHere’s what I came up with:\n\nSo, Faye was placing pencils and crayons into 7 rows (7 boxes) with 36 pencils (pencils) in each row (box). That means there are 36 pencils (pencils) in each of the 7 rows (boxes). 36 times 7 equals 252 pencils.\n"}

Nell had 528 baseball cards to start and gave some of them to Jeff. This means she has x cards left (Nell-528=252). However, we don't know how many she gave away (Nell's loss is Jeff's gain). So now that I've found out what Nell had before and after giving them away, I can use that information to help me find out how many she gave away. If Nell had 528 cards originally and has 252 cards left over, then she gave away 276 cards. This leaves 11 cards with Jeff, which is also correct according to the second part of the question.

So, we know that after he deleted some of the apps and files, he ended up with 5 files and 12 apps. So he deleted x apps and y files, where x > 5 and y > 12.\n\nTherefore: 24 apps - x = 12\n\n9 files - y = 5\n\nso x = 12 and y = 4.\n\nSo we know that there are 4 files and 12 apps left. So there are 8 more apps than files left.\n\nThis can also be confirmed by using our critical reasoning step:\n\n7 apps left - 1 file left = 6\n\n5 apps left - 2 files left = 3\n\n4 apps left - 3 files left = 1\n\nSo this makes it 7 files left - 0 files left = 7\n\nTherefore, after doing the critical reasoning step we can conclude that there are 7 more apps than files left.\n\nThis makes the correct answer 7.\n\nNow I want to test my answer by checking how likely it is that this is"}

This problem is similar to a comparison problem, where the information of absolute values of two quantities does not allow us to conclude the relationship between these two quantities. For instance, a height of 190 cm is larger than a height of 180 cm. However, the difference between 190 cm and 180 cm is much smaller than the difference between 190 cm and 170 cm. Similarly, even though we know that the number of ripe oranges is 19 more than that of unripe oranges per day, we still do not know how much bigger the number of ripe oranges is. The number could be 60 or 100 or even much more than that. In fact, a correct comparison should be 44:25, since we know that there are exactly 44 ripe oranges and 25 unripe oranges each day.

In this type of questions, it's important to avoid choosing the options that make direct comparisons with each other. \n\nWe have two variables: apples and names.

How many more apples does Jackie have than Adam?\nThis will be the correct answer since \"how many more\" is a comparison. In this type of questions, you can look for the answer that includes the word \"more\" or \"than\".\n2) Adam has 9 apples. Jackie has 10 apples. How many apples does Jackie have?\nThis is wrong since \"how many apples\" is an isolated variable. \n3) Adam has "}

But we need to consider the case of the answer 1396 to be correct. Given the number of teachers, we have to consider the number of students in a school. Given that number of teachers is a whole number and that is 772, we can safely say that 309 boys and 315 girls are not possible. If the number of teachers is 772, then the number of students can be 772+309=1081, 772+315=1087, and 772+769=1541. From this information, it is impossible to conclude the answer as 1000.
