How much did the candy bar cost?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "$ 3", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation:\n```This question can be modeled as a Markov process. I can start with any state I want, but eventually I will end up in a sink, which is a state that I can no longer make a move to from anywhere else. I have 4 states: $4, $3, $2, $1, with the sink being $0. When I have $4, I can either go to $3 or $2. When I have $3, I can either go to $2 or $1. When I have $2, I can either go to $1 or $0. And when I have $1, I can only go to $0.

How many cups of flour did she put in?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40% \n\nI thought of it like this: Mary puts in some flour and still needs 2 more cups. The number of cups she already put in is equal to the amount she still needs added together. 12 + 5 = 17. The amount she still needs is 2 cups. 12 + 2 = 14. Therefore, the amount of cups she already put in is 14. So I put 14.\n\nThe keywords in the answer are the number of cups of flour Mary already put in and the amount of cups of flour she still needs. The keywords in my answer are the total amount of cups of flour and the amount of cups of flour she still needs. I thought I could find out how much flour she already put in by subtracting the amount she still needs from the total amount of flour. \n\nI see that this isn't a very good method of reasoning because the answer 7 isn't one of the given options. Even if it were, I would have found the right answer since I would have ended up with 14 as the amount of cups of flour Mary already put in.

Thus, the sum of all points gained = the points gained in each round x the number of rounds.\nSince the score of each round is 46, and there are 177 rounds, the sum of all points gained = 46 x 177 = 8112.\nThe correct answer is 8112."}

To find out how many action figures he added, we can use the following reasoning:Jerry had 7 action figures before, and he added some more to the shelf. If the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 8, then he added 8 - 7 = 1 action figure to the shelf. But he also removed some of the old ones, so the total number of action figures he added is 1 + x, where x is the number of action figures he removed. To find x, we can subtract 1 from the total number of action figures on the shelf now, which gives us 8 - 1 = 7. So, he added 7 action figures to the shelf.\nTo check if this reasoning is correct, we can use the following calculation:\n7 - 10 + x = 8\n-3 + x = 8\nx = 8 + 3 = 11\nSo, he removed 11 action figures from the shelf, and he added "}

How many customers does he have now?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "4/3", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\nThere are 14 people left. 10 new people come in, giving a total of 24 people. Out of the original 14, 2 people left, so if there were 4/3 as many people originally, there would have been 16 people left after the 2 people left. Therefore, 16-14=2 people came back for a total of 24. Thus, 2 new people are needed to balance out the people who left and came back. Therefore, there were 4/3 people originally.\n```If someone else came in (10+1=11), that would give 15 people originally, which is a multiple of 3, and that makes sense. So it's possible there were 15 people originally, with 2 people leaving, and then 11 people coming in. 15+11=26. However, that is inconsistent with the statement \"he still had 14 customers\". So 4/3 is the only answer.```\n\n\nNote: This reasoning does not use '3' and '4', so that is additional information. '4/3' is used only because 3 people came back from the original 12.

However the number of cakes that were sold has to be less than the number of cakes that were made. So the correct answer has to be less than 69. The answer is not 80 either because 80 cakes were sold but 90 pastries were sold. So we know 10 cakes more than pastries were sold, so there is a difference of 20 more cakes than pastries. There are 58 pastries left over, and 20 more than pastries have been sold, so the number of cakes still available would be 58 + 20 = 78, so this is not the correct answer.

Provide your reasoning below:\nReasoning: In this question, we have the following data: \n- Razorback t-shirt shop made $51 dollars from selling 3 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.\n- We are asked to find the cost of each t-shirt.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a little bit of algebra. Let `x` be the cost of each t-shirt. Then, the total revenue from selling 3 t-shirts would be `3x`. We are given that this total revenue is $51. We can set up the following equation:\n`3x = 51`\nTo solve for `x`, we divide both sides by 3 to get:\n`x = 51/3`\nTherefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $17.\n\nIn this case, the answer is definitely `3`, as we have used the information provided in the question to arrive at a solution.\n\nI hope this helps!

The total number of books is 20, which can be inferred from the keywords 'crazy silly school' series and '20'. I subtract the number of books I have yet to read (5) from the total number of books (20) to determine the number of books I have already read (15).\n\nThis is a good example of a 'number line' problem. The number line starts at 0, and goes to 20.

I have never heard of cats eating fish but it can't be the case that there's not enough cats around to eat 15 fish so that must mean there's no goldfish left and that Paige's pond is a fish graveyard. There's also 2 other possible answers which are 4 and 6, 4 since she must have only been talking about goldfish and 6 since she must have only been talking about catfish, but I don't know why we'd think that. 6 feels more likely since we don't know what the pond is called. Also 5 feels like a more natural number than the others and makes it feel more likely to me. 1 and 2 aren't possible because Paige would have said it was only 12 if it were catfish. 3 is also not possible because it would've been more likely for her to use a word like 'left' to talk about what was left in the pond. 4 is not possible because if there was only 4 left there would've been more than that eaten.

And many of them can be reduced to finding a number in a set or the intersection of sets. The easiest way to get rid of keywords is to eliminate them, which means we need to reduce them to numbers. As a result, there are three cases we need to deal with, the set is a group, the set is an interval, or the set is the intersection of a group and an interval. \nIn this case, we can assume that there is at least one keyword from the first case, which is about a group. So we need to calculate 140 * 187. The keywords that belong to the second case, i.e. interval, are eliminated. \nThere are still some keywords that belong to the third case, which is about the intersection of the first and second cases. So we need to calculate the sum of the intersection of a group and an interval, which is 140 * (187 - 1 + 1) = 140 * 187. Then we can eliminate the keywords of the third case.\n\nTherefore, we obtain 140 * 187 = 3456700 as the answer.\n"}

However, for simplicity, we can continue to solve it.\n\nIt is given that there are 739 girls. 402 are more girls than boys. This implies that boys are 739-402 = 337 less than the total number of students in the school.\nThis also implies that the total number of students = (739 + 337) = 1076.\n\nTherefore, number of boys = 1076 - 739 = 337```\n\nThe possible answer is correct because the above reasoning is correct and gives the same answer.\n```"}

How much money did they make from selling the jerseys?", "correct answer": 152.0, "llm answer": "15376", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\nExplanation:\nThe Razorback shop makes 76 dollars off each jersey and 204 dollars off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 jerseys. To find how much money they made from selling the jerseys, we need to multiply the price of each jersey by the number of jerseys sold. The price of each jersey is $76, and the number of jerseys sold is 2. So, the total amount of money made from selling the jerseys is $76 × 2 = $152. The total amount of money made from selling the t-shirts is $204 × 158 = $32,272. The total amount of money made from selling both the jerseys and the t-shirts is $32,272 + $152 = $32,424.

How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "3.12", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nExplanation: First we need to read carefully all the question. Here we have two numbers (450 and 41). We need to find the fraction of 450 / 41. 41 does not go into 450 so we need to break down 450 into 420 and 30. The 41 pages will be broken down into 41x1=41 and 41x10=410, respectively. This is done because we are breaking 41 into 10x10x1 and 10x10x10, respectively. Now we see that 410 will be broken down into 400 and 10. We can now see that the answer is 450 / (41x1 + 41x10 + 410x1 + 410x10) = 3.12. We see that there are 30 days and the book has 450 pages.

How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?", "correct answer": 70.0, "llm answer": "248", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\nExplanation:\n1. Paul's friends brought him a box of 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. The question is how many more erasers than crayons he had left, which means we are looking for the amount of erasers he had left minus the amount of crayons he had left.\n2. At the end of the school year he only had 336 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. This tells us that the amount of erasers he had left must be 406. Now, with the information we have, we can deduct the amount of crayons he had left from the amount of erasers he had left to obtain the difference, i.e. 406 - 336 = 70.\n3. Now, considering that the question asks us to find out how many more erasers than crayons Paul had left, we need to make the difference negative. In other words, 70 - 406 = -336. Therefore, the answer to the question is -336, which is 248 in absolute value."}

Using the keywords, we can see that the most likely answer was created with multiplication method, therefore, 36 + 49 - 13 = 72, the answer is 72. \n\nReasoning: I tried out a lot of possible answers and the keywords don't make sense to me for most of them, so the keywords are only useful to filter out impossible options. However, after some analysis, I noticed that only \"addition way\" can result in 137 because only the addition method can get to 137 when there are 49 and 13. Therefore, I can get the answer by just trying to subtract 13 from 49, which is 72."}

We can start with a simple assumption: \n\"Did Frank read the whole book on day one?\" Let's say no. \nLet's say he did not read the entire book on day one, but he did read at least 1 page. This means there are now 611 pages left to read in the 5 remaining days.\nWhat is the maximum number of pages that Frank could have read on day one? If we assume that on each subsequent day he read the same number of pages, then the maximum number of pages read on day one is 102 pages. So, 102 pages is the upper bound.\nWhat is the minimum number of pages that Frank could have read on day one? Again, assuming that on each subsequent day he read the same number of pages, the minimum number of pages read on day one is 1. So, 1 page is the lower bound.\nTherefore, the answer must be between 1 and 102 pages. The possible answer is within this range, so it is very likely that it is the correct answer.\n"}

This is the sum of two multiplications, so we need to find out the number of multiplications in the answer to check if it matches this evidence. The answer is 2 multiplications, so we can conclude that the answer matches this evidence.\n\nThe second piece of evidence was '15 x 19'. This is the answer to a multiplication. So, we need to check if the number of multiplications in the answer is the same as the number of multiplications in this piece of evidence. The answer is 1 multiplication, so we can conclude that the answer matches this evidence.\n\nThe third piece of evidence was '62 x 19'. This is the answer to a multiplication. So, we need to check if the number of multiplications in the answer is the same as the number of multiplications in this piece of evidence.

{"question": "Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?", "correct answer": 128.0, "llm answer": "128", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation: The question is asking how much Jessie weighed before jogging. We can solve this with subtraction because Jessie weighed 27 kilograms after jogging. Subtraction tells us to put the lower number below, so:\n$$\\begin{align} \n27 - 101 =? \\newline\n-74 =? \\newline\n128 =? \\newline\n\\end{align}$$\nNote: $-74$ kilograms would also be correct because subtraction can be performed in any order. The question states that Jessie lost weight, so the subtraction can be rearranged as:\n$$\\begin{align} \n27 - 101 =? \\newline\n-101 + 27 =? \\newline\n-74 =? \\newline\n\\end{align}$$\nThere are two other ways to answer this question. If you notice that Jessie weighed 27 kilograms after jogging, the first number after subtraction would be 27 kilograms. Since 27 - 101 = -74, the answer would be $-74$ kilograms. \n\nAnother option is to notice that 101 kilograms is 4 times greater than 27 kilograms, since $4 \\times 27 = 108$ kilograms. This is equivalent to subtracting 4 times 27, which"}

How many planks does John need for the house wall?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "588", "confidence": 0.96, "probing response": "96%\nExplanation of reasoning: 74 nails to secure a plank means that there are 74 nails per 1 plank. For the whole wall of the house, it would need 8 planks to build, so the number of nails needed is equal to 8 planks. So, we need 8 x 74 nails. The question says, \"If each plank of wood needs 74 pieces of nails to be secured\" so this means that it only uses one plank to build the walls of the house. So we should multiply 8 x 74 x 8, to get 588. So, we can be very confident with the answer of 588.\n\nQ: You are building a fence.

Let's first calculate the amount of money Lewis earns every week. He earns $403 every week during the 233 weeks of harvest, so the amount of money he earns every week is $403 × 233 = $ 93959. We also know that he has to pay $49 rent every week, so the amount of money he pays every week is $49 × 233 = $ 11417. We can calculate the amount of money Lewis earns during harvest season by subtracting the amount of money he pays from the amount of money he earns every week. The amount of money Lewis earns during harvest season is $ 93959 - $ 11417 = $ 82542. Therefore, the correct answer is $82542."}

How much did Edward have before he spent his money?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "$ 22", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nExplanation: Edward has a total of $16. He buys 92 books costing $16. So, the cost of each book = 16/92 = 0.17. Edward has $6 left. So, we can say the cost of 6 books = 0.17*6 = 1. So, 6 books cost him $1 and he bought 92 books costing him $16. So, the total number of books = (16/1) = 16. So, he had 16*92 = 1472 books originally. Now, $1472 = 16 + 56, where 56 is the money he has left. So, he had a total of $16 + $56 = $72.

During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey? Answer: A t-shirt costs $ 211.16 more than a jersey.”\n    - ##### joshwheeler0 says: I know 240*177=42,720. I know that they sold 23 jerseys. So I know that 210*23=4,830. I can subtract 4,830 from 42,720 to get the total. 37,410-4,830=32,580. This tells me that 32,580/23 is how much they made on each jersey. 32,580/23=1,411. The answer is $211.16 more. I am 95% confident in this answer."}

It's clear that the number of days will be some multiple of 30, so the 36 is irrelevant for now. We only have 8 drums, so we divide 240 drums by 8 and get 30. Now we multiply 30 and 36 to get 1080.

If he initially had 30 pieces of candy. How many pieces of candy does he still have left?\" \nFirst, I read the keywords and get that Bobby had initially had 30 pieces of candy. Then, I know that if I subtract 23 pieces from 30 pieces, I will get the number of candy that he still has left.\nI know that if Bobby had 30 pieces of candy, and he eats 23 pieces of candy, then he must still have 7 pieces of candy left. Since he starts with 30 pieces of candy, and he has to eat 23 pieces of candy, he will end with 7 pieces of candy left.\n\nIn order to know how many pieces of candy he still has, I have to subtract 23 pieces of candy from 30 pieces of candy. \nThen I get 30 - 23 = 7, so there are 7 pieces of candy left.\n\nThere is no keyword that is not used.

Since 3 birds were already on the fence before any more birds and storks arrived, that means that at least 3 birds (and 3 storks) must have arrived. This means that the total number of birds on the fence must be either 6 or 9. However, since 6 more storks came to join them, that means that the total number of storks on the fence must be either 9 or 12. This means that the difference between the number of storks and the number of birds must be either 0 or 8. Therefore, the correct answer is 8 storks more than birds.\n\nThe confidence I have in this answer is 100%. The reasoning is very straightforward and I don't see any way to interpret the problem that would lead to a different answer."}

This means that each jersey is $ 146 more expensive than a t-shirt. If they sold 43 jerseys, then the total revenue from jersey sales is 43 * $ 232 = $ 9,996. If they sold 254 t-shirts, then the total revenue from t-shirt sales is 254 * $ 86 = $ 21,804.

How is the question connected to the answer? Please also write down your reasoning for answering 56. Thanks.\n\nMy reasoning: I used a simple rule: number of items divided by number of packages. I also checked my answer by calculating the number of shirts, which was 28×56=1568. So my answer was definitely correct. But the question said \"can be purchased\" (which is similar to the phrase \"I am willing to buy\"). I used \"buying\" instead of \"selling\" (because in some places selling shirts is a crime) and that made me think the question was about how many shirts are in one package. So I answered with 56, which is the number of shirts in each package.\n\nQ: Can you please provide more reasoning? Thank you!\n\nMy reasoning: 28 packages × 56 shirts/package = 1568 shirts in total. Since we are trying to find how many shirts in each package, we need to divide 1568 by 28 which is 56. Also, we can multiply 28×56 and get 1568 shirts in total."}

The original statement is \"How many oranges will they have after 87 days of harvest?\" which is a multiplication problem, because it asks how many oranges. So we know that we will multiply a number of oranges to 87 days to see how many oranges they have. \n2. The keywords in the first sentence \"He then went to see the oranges being harvested.\" tells us the activity of the oranges. Which is that they are being harvested. This means that they are growing in quantity. \n3. The keywords in the second sentence \"He found out that they harvest 66 sacks per day and that each sack containes 25 oranges\" tell us the number of oranges that are harvested in one day. So if they harvest 66 sacks per day and each sack contains 25 oranges, then we know that they harvest 25x66= 1650 oranges in one day. \n4. The keywords in the third sentence \"How many oranges will they have after 87 days of harvest?\" tell us that we are going to multiply 1650 by 87 to see how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvest.

But the keywords don't provide any relevant information about the quantity of crayons Paul received. So it's likely that it is incorrect, but I'm not sure exactly what to say as the answer is given as 177 and 551 so you would think that we are meant to add them together. 728 is only 8 more than the sum of the given crayons but maybe there were 8 that weren't mentioned? This seems like a guess. However, I think the answer is probably correct because if the question was more detailed, it probably would've included more keywords. There could be an underlying connection with the keywords. I am a bit unsure as this is a very specific scenario and the question wording is so detailed. I suppose I can say the keywords are only about Paul, so that means that the answer is likely to be correct. I just feel like there's something I've missed.\n\nThe answer is the sum of the number of crayons Paul lost and gave away. So the answer could be any number greater than 177 and less than 551.

How many red and yellow peaches are in the basket?", "correct answer": 32.0, "llm answer": "18 red peaches, 14 yellow peaches", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: This is a problem with 5 peaches (the basket has 5 peaches, 1 red, 1 yellow and 3 green). There are 5 ways to select 1 peach with no constraint. Therefore, the total number of peaches should be 5! = 120, not 49. We know that there are 17 green peaches in the basket. We need to subtract the number of green peaches from the total number of peaches to get the number of red and yellow peaches. So we have 120 - 17 = 103 peaches (red or yellow). Then, we know that there are 14 yellow peaches. Thus, there are 103 - 14 = 89 red peaches. We know that there are 17 green peaches and 14 yellow peaches, so the number of red peaches is 18 (since 18 + 17 + 14 = 49). \n\nExplanation 2: We are given the following information: 18 red peaches, 14 yellow peaches, and 17 green peaches in the basket.

How much more did his dad's strawberries weigh than his?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\n**Explanation of reasoning:**\nWe know that Marco and his dad went together to pick strawberries. That means they both have strawberries. We also know that they combined weighed a total of 26 pounds. The sum of the number of pounds of strawberries that Marco and his dad picked must be 26. Since Marco's strawberries weigh 10 pounds and their sum is 26, then the total number of pounds of strawberries that his dad picked is 16 pounds. Now, we know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds. If we subtract the number of pounds of strawberries that Marco picked from the total number of pounds of strawberries that his dad picked, then we get 16 - 10, which is equal to 6 pounds. Therefore, the number of pounds of strawberries that his dad picked is 6 pounds more than the number of pounds of strawberries that Marco picked.\n\nWe can also think about this problem using reasoning in the following way. We know that the total number of pounds of strawberries that Marco and his dad picked is 26. If we subtract the number of pounds of strawberries that Marco picked from the total number of pounds of strawberries that they picked, then we get 26 - 10, which is equal to 16.

If Josh lost 23 marbles and he found 9 marbles, then the number of marbles lost must be greater than the number of marbles found. Since 9 < 23, it is correct to say that Josh lost 23 marbles, which is greater than the 9 marbles that he found.

This means that the total score is 146 multiplied by the number of rounds. Since 146 × 157 = 22978, the answer is 22978.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to use a method called dimensional analysis. First, we identify the unknown quantity as the number of rounds. We then set up a proportion where the units on one side of the equal sign are the same as the units on the other side. The units are points and rounds, and we know that 146 points are gained in each round. Therefore, the proportion is: \n146 points per round x number of rounds = 22978 points\nSolving this proportion for the number of rounds, we get:\nnumber of rounds = (22978 points) ÷ (146 points per round) = 157 rounds\n\nThis means that Luke played 157 rounds of the trivia game and scored 22978 points.\n"}

How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?", "correct answer": 274.0, "llm answer": "75.9%", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100.0%\n```\nReasoning:\n\nThe keywords provide two pieces of useful information:\n\n• It's about a large number of visitors, so it's unlikely that the previous day's number of visitors was a single-digit number.\n• The previous day's number of visitors was 75% or more of the total number of visitors within the past 327 days.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the previous day's number of visitors was about 75% of 406, which is around 300. So the most likely answer is indeed 75.9%.\n\nHowever, this is only one interpretation of the given keywords. There may be other interpretations that lead to different conclusions.
