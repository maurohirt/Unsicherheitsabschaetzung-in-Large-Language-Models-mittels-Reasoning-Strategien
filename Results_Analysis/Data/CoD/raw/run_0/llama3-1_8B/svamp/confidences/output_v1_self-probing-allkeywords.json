How many boys are there in that school?", "correct answer": 469.0, "llm answer": "965", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nJustification: As mentioned in the question, the number of boys is x. Thus, it is clear that the value of x will be obtained by adding 697 + x or subtracting 697 - x. It is also mentioned that there are 228 more girls than boys. Thus, the difference between girls and boys will be 697 - x + 228. If we are given a value for this difference, then we can obtain x. In our case, we have 697 - x + 228 = 965. If we simplify, we will get 697 - x = 965 - 228 = 737. If we add 697 to both sides, we get x = 697 + 737 = 965.\n\nQ: How about another answer? In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys.

Then, x students got on the bus and y students got off. This means that there are 68 + x - y students on the bus. The problem tells us that there are 12 students on the bus, which means that 68 + x - y = 12. Solving for x, we get x = y - 56. This means that y = x + 56, which means that y = 56 more than x. The problem asks for the difference between x and y, which is x + 56 - x = 56. This is how you find the correct answer, which is 56. ```\n"}

First consider 18 green peaches * 6 baskets. This would give a total of 108 green peaches. \n\n2. Subtract 108 green peaches from 204 peaches and you get 96 red peaches.\n\n3. This is not possible.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis is not a good explanation. The reasoning is correct but it is written down in a confusing way and some of the steps are not given. To solve this problem correctly, the key is to remember that there are 18 green peaches per basket, so the total number of green peaches must be a multiple of 18. If you subtract 108 green peaches, there will be 18 green peaches remaining, but we don't know what the other peaches are. \n\nThe correct answer is 204, which is the total number of peaches in all baskets. 96 red peaches, the remaining peaches after subtracting 108 green peaches, and 108 green peaches are both multiples of 18, which makes the total number of peaches a multiple of 18 as well.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not even sure how to make sense of the keyword \"18 green peaches * 6 baskets"}

If Helen baked more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cakes, then the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of raisin cakes will be positive; otherwise, the difference will be negative. Thus, to find the answer to this question, we can calculate the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and the number of raisin cakes and see if it is positive or negative. To calculate this difference, we can subtract the number of raisin cakes from the number of chocolate chip cookies: 237 - 231 = 6. This means that Helen baked 6 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cakes. Therefore, the correct answer is 6."}

{"question": "Paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies. He ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies. How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?", "correct answer": 13.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n```Explanation:```\n```Considering that Paco has 40 sweet cookies, he could eat no more than 20 of them. So we can eliminate answers that have Paco eating more than 20 sweet cookies. The rest is not so obvious, since we need to compare Paco's choices of the salty cookies and sweet cookies. If we simply count the number of the salty cookies and sweet cookies Paco ate, we would think the best answer would be 3. However, if we consider the total number of cookies Paco had, and notice Paco ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies, we see Paco actually ate 43 cookies, which is only 1 more than his total number of cookies. This means Paco ate the same number of salty cookies and sweet cookies, and so 3 is the correct answer.\n```\n\nPossible Answer: 3"}

How many minutes was the machine working?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "120 minutes", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60% \n\nAnswer:\n1. The problem is to solve the question by knowing the number of shirts it can make per minute and the number of shirts it made in total.\n2. It is clear that there is an unknown value in the equation, which can be solved using the 6 shirts it made and 3 shirts per minute. This suggests that there is one unknown variable and it is the amount of time.\n3. The division operation `÷` implies division, which suggests that there is one variable in the equation and it is the number of shirts.\n4. `2 × 60` implies that the product is `120`, which suggests that there is one variable in the equation and it is the number of shirts.\n5. `120 min` implies that the time is `120` minutes, which suggests that there is one variable in the equation and it is the number of shirts.\n\nThe above reasoning suggests that the above answer is 120 minutes, which is correct.

In the first step, Frank put candy in bags. This step is solved using the multiplication rule. \n26 bags × 33 pieces = 858 pieces\nWe know from the multiplication rule that the result of multiplying two whole numbers is always a whole number. So, 858 has to be a whole number. However, this rule doesn't give any information about the size of the result of the multiplication. So, we are still not sure if the answer is correct.\nIn the second step, Frank has 858 pieces of candy, so he gave 858/26 = 33 pieces of candy to each bag. That means 858 is divisible by 26 and we know from the divisibility rule that only multiples of 26 are divisible by 26. So, we can be 100% sure that 858 is the correct answer.\n\n```Confidence: 90.0%```"}

Suppose you start with 4 chocolates and lose one to get 3 chocolates left. \n\n- How many chocolates would you need to lose to get 1 chocolate left? \n\n- Can you start with any number of chocolates and still get 1 chocolate left after losing one? Can you explain your reasoning? \n\n- Let's consider the price of the candy bar. Suppose the price of the candy bar is $1. How much would you need to pay for the candy bar to be left with $3? \n\n- Suppose the price of the candy bar is $2.

{"question": "Paul got a box of 253 crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 70 of them. How many crayons did he have left by the end of the school year?", "correct answer": 183.0, "llm answer": "183", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: Given that the question asks for the number of crayons he has left by the end of the school year, and that he has a box of 253 crayons on his birthday, he must have used some crayons. It is also given that by the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 70 crayons. The keywords help in clarifying that the question does not ask for the number of crayons he used during the school year. Based on these two facts, we can infer that Paul had 253 crayons at the start of the school year and 183 crayons at the end of the school year. Therefore, the correct answer is 183.\n\n"}

How many more customers left than those that stayed behind?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: The answer of 8 is the answer that came to my mind before reading the question. However, I am not sure that this answer would still be the most plausible one if given the extra information provided by the keywords. I think that the extra information can also be described by a formula and thus can be used to calculate the new probability. The following calculation would lead to the result that the probability is not 8 anymore:\n```11-3=8\n(11-3) / 11 = 8/11\n8/11 * 100 = 72,72%```\nHowever, the reasoning behind this calculation is the same as that which leads to the answer of 8. To my knowledge, there is no better solution. Nevertheless, I think that the additional information does not have a significant effect on the answer. Thus, the probability should still be 8. I do not yet have a better way of thinking about the keywords. I would be happy to hear about suggestions in this respect.\n"}

How much did Edward have before he spent his money?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "$ 17", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nReasoning:\n```First, we consider the keyword '7' to be the 'current' money that Edward has. Then we need to calculate how much money Edward had 'before' he spent the $ 17. The keyword '10' is the money Edward received from his friend. Thus, it must be calculated 'before' he received the money. So the keyword '10' is a part of the 'before' situation, and so '7' and '10' together are the 'before' amount of money that Edward had. 17 is the total amount of money Edward has. 'Before' he spent his money, the remaining '7' money is what he has 'left' (that is the amount that he has when he didn't spend the money yet). The amount of money that is 'left' is the total amount of money he has 'before' spending money. Hence, we can infer that the total amount of money Edward has 'before' spending money is $ 7, and the 'before' money amount he has is $ 7. ```\n"}

How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?", "correct answer": 70.0, "llm answer": "248", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: \n\n* Paul had 601 crayons, and he still had 336 crayons at the end of the year, so 265 crayons must have been lost.\n* Paul had 406 erasers, and he still had the same amount at the end of the year, so he had 406 erasers still left.\n* There were 265 crayons lost. If there were 406 erasers still left, then 406 - 265 = 141 erasers must have been lost as well.\n* There were 601 crayons total, and 265 of those were lost, so 601 - 265 = 336 crayons must have been left over.\n* There were 336 crayons left and 406 erasers. Since 336 crayons were left, 406 - 336 = 70 erasers must have been left.\n* If 265 crayons were lost and 406 erasers were left, then 265 + 70 = 335 erasers must have been lost.\n* If 335 erasers were lost, 406 - 335 = 71 erasers must have been left.\n* 71 erasers must have been left and 336 crayons.

How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nReasoning: I think the sugar is correct as I have 5 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour and I have 11 cups of flour, which means I still need 14-11 = 3 cups of flour. But why 14, 5, 11, 3, and 3 cups of sugar all appear in the question? It's easy for us to count them out as we see these numbers and the relationship between them, but how to do this on machines? It will be easy to do counting once we have those numbers in an array or some sort of list form. But for the machine, how can we know what the relationship is and store it in the list of numbers?\n\nFor example, 14 and 11 are related, as they are 14-11 = 3; 14, 11, and 5 are related, as we still need 14-11 = 3 cups of sugar.

How many days would the soda bottles last?", "correct answer": 64.0, "llm answer": "1.31 days", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n```The reasoning is as followings: Debby bought 200 water bottles and 256 soda bottles. If she drank 312 water bottles and 4 soda bottles a day, then after she drank 312 water bottles, there are 312-200=112 water bottles left, so there are 256-112=144 soda bottles left. Because she drank 4 soda bottles a day, so it would last 144/4=36 days. Considering that there are 0.5 soda bottles left, the number of days that the soda bottles would last is 36+0.5=36.5. However, the given answer 1.31 days is incorrect, which means the calculation is wrong. After considering that there are 1.5 soda bottles left, the number of days that the soda bottles would last is 36.5+1.5=38.

There is no more information about the number of rowers during the day.\n2. Therefore I think the number of rowers in the morning is equal to the number of rowers in the afternoon and evening (13*3=39), which is larger than the maximum number of rowers allowed to participate in one session. Therefore it is impossible that the number of rowers in the morning, afternoon and evening are all the same.\n3. It is more likely that the number of rowers in the morning and afternoon are the same, as it is easier to split the group into 2 sessions if the number of rowers are even. Also there should be the same number of rowers in the morning and afternoon sessions because of the information that they went rowing in the afternoon. Therefore I think the most likely number of rowers in the morning and afternoon are 25.\n4. Since the number of rowers in the morning and afternoon are not specified, it can be that they are the same as in the evening (49). Therefore 25+25+49=99.```\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 99 and my confidence is 40%.\n\nAnswer: 40\n"}

There are 8 more green peaches than yellow peaches because 8 + 6 = 14.\n\n## 6.1.1 Inference through similarity\nReasoning in this case is through similarity.

Hence the answer is **4**. \n\nThe confidence score is 80%, since this question is more like a direct multiplication of 2 and 8 (which is the correct answer to question 5), and I think that a good understanding of the keywords given would lead to a correct answer.\n\n### Additional Note\nThe confidence score above assumes Matthew gave away crackers **individually** to each of his friends. However, another possible understanding of the sentence can be that Matthew gave away crackers to each group of 2 friends. This would result in the total number of friends being 8/2 = 4, which is not the correct answer to this question."}

How many extra invitations will she need to buy?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50.0%\nExplanation: The number of friends is 9. This is not a multiple of the number of invitations in a package, so she will need to buy some extra. There are two packages. If we divide 9 by 3, we get 3. So there must be 3 extra invitations. Note that she does not need to buy 2 more packages, because there are only 3 more invitations required."}

{"question": "Paul got a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers. How many crayons had been lost or given away?", "correct answer": 367.0, "llm answer": "367", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nReasoning:\n```Since erasers was not given away, then 154 is the total amount of erasers left after the end of school year.\nLet x be the amount of erasers Paul had initially. Since 154 is the total amount of erasers left, we have: 154 + x - 154 = x => x = 0\nLet y be the total amount of crayons Paul had at the end of the school year. The question states: Paul only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers. This means Paul had only crayons left after the end of the school year. In other words, y is the amount of crayons lost or given away.\nLet z be the total amount of crayons Paul had initially. Hence, z - y = 154\nFrom above we know: x = 0, z - y = 154 and z = 521.\nSolving the above, y = 367.```"}

{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "16", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nReasoning: Since 10 bottle caps plus 62 wrappers is equal to 27 bottle caps plus 43 wrappers, the number of wrappers needs to be 27 larger than the number of bottle caps. So it is the 16th answer. I am 90% sure this is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: 90%\nReasoning: There is the same number of bottle caps and wrappers in the first half of the sentence. This means that there is no bottle cap that doesn't have a wrapper and no wrapper that doesn't have a bottle cap. Danny also collected some more bottle caps and wrappers. This means that if Danny has 10 bottle caps, he has 10 wrappers, and if Danny has 27 bottle caps, he has 27 wrappers. To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now, we subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps. 27 - 10 = 17. So we need to find the 17th answer to find the correct answer. We can find the 17th answer by noticing that there are 8 answers that are multiples of 2. If we can find a way to make the numbers not have a multiple of 2, then we can find the"}

We are then told that Paco initially had 37 cookies. The question asks us how many cookies Paco has left. \n\nTo solve this question, we need to consider the situation where we remove 36 cookies from Paco's initial 37 cookies, leaving us with 1 cookie. This is because subtracting 36 from 37 leaves us with 1 remaining cookie. So, Paco has 1 cookie left after eating 36 cookies.\n\n# Solving the example\nTo solve this question, we can use the following reasoning:\n* We are told that Paco ate 36 cookies.\n* We are also told that Paco initially had 37 cookies.\n* To find out how many cookies Paco has left, we can subtract the number of cookies he ate from his initial number of cookies.\n* This leaves us with 1 remaining cookie, since 37 - 36 = 1.\n\n# Conclusion\nOverall, this problem involves subtracting two numbers to find out how many objects remain after some of them were removed."}

It is unclear whether Jack received 4 emails in the morning and then 6 in the afternoon, or whether the 4 received in the morning were included in the 6 received in the afternoon. Without the original question, it's impossible to know for certain. However, we can make some reasonable assumptions based on the context and the keywords provided. \n\nFirst, let's assume that Jack received 4 emails in the morning and then 6 in the afternoon, which would make a total of 10 emails received throughout the day. Based on this assumption, we can infer that Jack must have sent 2 letters in the morning and 8 in the afternoon, resulting in a total of 10 letters sent throughout the day.\n\nNow, let's consider the keywords provided. The phrase \"Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters in the morning\" suggests that Jack sent 2 letters while he was receiving 4 emails. This implies that the 2 letters were sent as a response to the 4 emails received. Similarly, the phrase \"He then received 6 emails and sent 8 letters in the afternoon\" suggests that Jack sent 8 letters while he was receiving 6 emails, again implying"}
{"question": "Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework and 8 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of reading homework than biology homework did she have?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "Rachel had 3 more pages of reading homework than biology homework.", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nExplanation: I assume, since the question is asking for \"how many more pages\", the correct answer would be in the form of a number. The only other number that appears in the question, is the difference between 7 and 11, which is 4. Therefore, the correct answer would have to be a multiple of 4. We can't say that the answer is 4, because that doesn't match the keywords. However, if the answer is 4, we can't say that it is incorrect, because that doesn't match the keywords either. For example, if we choose \"Rachel had 4 pages of reading homework than biology homework\", we would have to reason that the question is actually asking for \"how many more pages Rachel had\". Since Rachel had 7 pages of math homework, she had 11 pages of reading homework and she had 8 pages of biology homework, we know she had 7 + 11 + 8 = 26 pages of homework. Therefore, she had 26 - 7 = 19 pages of non-math homework, which means that she had 11 - 8 = 3 pages of reading homework. Therefore, she had 4 pages of reading homework than biology homework."}

This means that Dan has $2, he bought some candy bar for $6, each costing $3. From these keywords, it is implied that the value of the candy bar is 3$ and Dan has 2$ for buying candy bar.

Since the question is about how many pastries Baker will still have, we should try to find out how many pastries there are and what the relation is between each of the numbers above. \n\nThe keyword \"29 pastries\" is very obvious here. It suggests that the number of pastries should be 29, but this cannot be true since that would not be a reasonable choice. \n\nThen let us consider the \"56 pastries\". If we assume that it represents the total number of pastries, then it must be wrong because there are only 29 pastries left. \n\nThen let us consider the \"124 cakes\". This number is very close to 29 and 56, so it might be a combination of the number of pastries and cakes. If we assume that it represents the total number of pastries and cakes, then we can find that 56-29"}

But we know that he has 10 action figures now on the shelf, 2 more and 7 less than the original number. This means that the number of action figures Jerry had initially on the shelf can be deduced from these numbers by adding 7 to the number of action figures Jerry added, or by subtracting the number of action figures Jerry removed from the total number of action figures Jerry has on the shelf now.\n\nLet the number of action figures Jerry had initially on the shelf be x. Then the total number of action figures Jerry has on the shelf now is x + 2 and the number of action figures Jerry has removed from the shelf is 7. Therefore, x + 2 - 7 = x + (2 - 7) = x + -5 = x - 5 = 10. This gives us the possible answer 8 because x = 8.\n\nLet the number of action figures Jerry had initially on the shelf be y.

Therefore, the reasonings are more than likely sufficient enough to conclude that the answer is indeed 10. This can be seen from the fact that we are given the following two facts: \n\n(1) The book has 23 pages. \n\n(2) The first chapter is 10 pages long. \n\nSince, there are two chapters and 10 pages belong to the first chapter, we know that the other 13 pages belong to the second chapter. By deductive reasoning, we know that 13 pages are in the second chapter, and thus 10 pages are in the first chapter.\n\nThe second paragraph gives information on how one could have reached this answer. This paragraph is not necessary for the purpose of answering this question as it is not a multiple choice question. \n\nThe last paragraph also gives additional information, but does not contain any useful keywords. \n\nConclusion:\nFrom these three paragraphs, we have 23 pages, 10 pages in the first chapter, and 13 pages in the second chapter.

In this case, all questions are related to Josh, and so all keywords are related to all questions.\nSince we already know the correct answer, the best thing we can do is to start with the other answers and then see how the information fits with them.\n\nSince we know there are 7 marbles in Josh's collection, we can subtract 8 to get 15. However, the answer is not 15 but 2 more, so we can assume that there must be 2 more than 15 marbles in his collection. This means that the answer must be greater than 15. This makes answer 2 the only possible answer.\n\nBut why is answer 2 the only possible answer? The other answers are 15, 16, and 18. The first two are not greater than 15, so they can be discarded.

{"question": "David did 27 more push-ups but 7 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. How many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nReasoning:\n```For the question, we are given 2 pieces of information. We are told that David did more push-ups but fewer crunches than Zachary. Zachary did 5 push-ups and 17 crunches. Let's let p and c be the number of push-ups and crunches David did, respectively. Now we can create our first equation. If David did 27 more push-ups but 7 less crunches than Zachary, then p = (5 + 27) and c = (17 - 7). Now we can substitute our original information to create an equation. p = 5 + 27 and c = 17 - 5. Substituting p with 5 + 27, we get c = 17 - 5 + 27. Simplifying, we get c = 17 + 22 = 39. So if David did 39 crunches and 5 + 27 = 32 push-ups, we can now get the difference between crunches and push-ups. 39 - 32 = 7. So it seems David did 7 more crunches than push-ups. Therefore, David did 7 more crunches than Zachary. Zachary did 5"}

How many apples did the tree have to begin with?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nReasoning: the number of apples decreases 4 to 2 in total, and the number of unripe apples decrease 2 to 0. So 4 must be the decrease of unripe apples, and 2 the decrease of ripe apples. If we know the unripe apples were initially 4, we know how many apples the tree had in the beginning.\n\nAnother reasoning: \"the ratio of ripe apples to the total apples decreases from 2:4 to 2:6\""}

How many days did he take to finish the book?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "28", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: (The following is just to give a detailed explanation of your reasoning. It is totally optional. If you don't feel like writing such a detailed explanation, just skip the following part.)\n\nThe first step of reasoning is to find out the units of these keywords. For example, if we have the keywords '4 miles' and '50 minutes', the unit of '4 miles' is mile, and the unit of '50 minutes' is minute.\n\nIn this question, we have the keywords '14 pages' and '392 pages', the unit of '14 pages' is page, and the unit of '392 pages' is page.\n\nThe second step is to find out the relationship between these units. In this question, there is one relationship between pages and days. We know the keyword '14 pages', and '392 pages' equals '392 / 14' times of '14 pages'.\n\nThe third step is to find out the relationship between these two times. For example, we have the keywords '50 minutes' and '1 hour', and we know '1 hour' equals '60' times of '1 minute'. So, the number of '50 minutes' is '50' times of the number of '1 minute'.\n\nIn this"}

Considering Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles, if Ed had 60 more marbles than Doug, after the two changes, Ed would still have 60+9=69 more marbles than Doug. Since 60+9=69 is much greater than 27, it is very likely that Ed still has more marbles than Doug after the two changes.\n"}

How many cakes would baker still have?", "correct answer": 59.0, "llm answer": "59", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: We know 108 cakes + 44 pastries = 152, but we were told there were 167 cakes, and we subtracted 108 from 167 to get 59 cakes. But this is incorrect. Let's check with 152 pastries.\n\nLet's check with 108 pastries, since we are told 108 pastries sold, which means the remaining number of pastries (167-108) should be 59. This is what we would conclude based on the keywords. However, we need to think about the problem again since the keywords could have mislead us.\nIf we have 167 cakes and 44 pastries, and we sell 108 cakes and 44 pastries, that means we sell 44 pastries out of 44 pastries (100% sold), but 64 out of 167 cakes (38.31%). That means 38.31% of our 167 cakes are still unsold. 167 cakes - 64 cakes (unsold) = 103 cakes sold. This is where we could have made the error.\n\nSo 108 cakes + 44 pastries = 152 is the correct number we have left.\n```"}

How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "5 cups more flour than sugar.", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation:\n```Let the cups of flour be x.\nMary put 7 cups of flour so far.\nThen, she needs x-7 cups of flour.\nAlso, the cups of sugar are 2.\nSo, the number of cups of flour is more than the number of cups of sugar by (x-7)-2 cups = x-9 cups.\nSince the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour, 10-x cups of flour have been used.\nSo, x-7-x+10 = 10-7 = 3 cups of flour is remaining. \nThen, (x-7)-(3+x) = -2+x-7 = -9+x = 3 cups less.\nTherefore, the answer is \"3 cups less\".```\n```Note that, if the problem has 4 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups of sugar, then the answer will be \"1 cup less\" instead of \"3 cups less\". This is because the number of cups of flour is more than the number of cups of sugar by (x-7)-(4+x) = -5+x = 1 cups. So, the number of cups of flour remaining is 4-7 = -3 cups. Finally, -3+"}

How many more eggs does Rebecca have than marbles?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: (1) \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 20\" suggests she has some groups of 20 and wants to split the collection into these groups. Since Rebecca has marbles, eggs, and groups of 20, the eggs that are not in groups of 20 are left over. (2) \"Rebecca has 5 marbles and 12 eggs\" suggests there are at most 5 groups of 20. So the number of eggs not in groups of 20 is no larger than 12 - 5 = 7.
