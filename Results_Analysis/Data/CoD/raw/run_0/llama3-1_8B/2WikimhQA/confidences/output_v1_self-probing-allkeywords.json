Reasoning\nFirst of all, we know that the Roman Empire was once ruled by 5 emperors and that these emperors had their own children. We can identify them from the following list:\n- Augustus - Julius Caesar's grand nephew.\n- Tiberius - Augustus' stepson.\n- Caligula - Tiberius' great-nephew.\n- Claudius - Caligula's brother-in-law.\n- Nero - Claudius' adopted son.\n\nAlso, we have the fact that \"Cornelia\" is Augustus' daughter. Since he had one wife, we can conclude that there is only one \"Cornelia\" in this question. \n\nTherefore, we can use these facts to find a connection between \"Cornelia\" and one of the above emperors. \n\nFirstly, let's identify the answer choices that are not connected to \"Cornelia\" through an emperor:\n- Antony - the answer choice.

The reasoning is as follows:\n* Livilla, the mother of Livilla is Antonia Major, which is one of the keywords. The mother of Antonia Major is Augustus's sister. (We can derive this by checking the pedigree of Augustus and Antonia the Elder from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_Emperor)\n* Augustus's sister's husband is Livia.

It is the first medieval state of independent Hispania, and the predecessor of the modern Principality of Asturias. The Kingdom of Asturias continued until it split into smaller kingdoms in the ninth century, one of which became the Kingdom of León. The kingdom's language was Latin with the beginnings of Old Asturian. The kingdom was characterized by the conversion of its population to Christianity, and the Codex Albeldensis or Liber Testamentorum was a source of information on its early history. The language of the kingdom was Latin with the beginnings of Old Asturian. The earliest known records in Asturian are from the Glosas Emilianenses, dated to the 9th or 10th century. The earliest known document written in Old Asturian (although written by a clergyman trained in Latin) is a record in the Fuero de Avilés written around 927.
