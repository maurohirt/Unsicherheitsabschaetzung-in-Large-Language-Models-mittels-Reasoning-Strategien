The key words to focus on are \"paternal\" and \"grandfather\", as they indicate a relationship between the 17th Earl of Oxford and his paternal grandfather. To begin, we can see that the 17th Earl of Oxford was indeed his paternal grandfather's son. This can be inferred from the statement \"Edward De Vere was the 17th Earl of Oxford\". Therefore, we can eliminate answer options B and D, as they do not fit this description. Next, we can look at answer option C, which mentions \"Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford's father\". This does not fit the description of the paternal grandfather, as a father is the direct father of someone, not the grandparent. Therefore, we can also eliminate answer option C. Finally, we are left with answer option A, which is \"Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford's paternal grandfather\". This fits the description of the paternal grandfather, as it is the direct paternal grandfather of the 17th Earl of Oxford. Therefore, answer option A is the correct answer."}

For instance, the prince might have had more than one grandparent on his father's side, but they were all called grandfather. In this case, we cannot determine which of the grandfathers was Otto of Anhalt-Aschersleben. \n\nSecond, the prince might have been called by a different name other than grandfather.

Since I already assume that Zhang Yi is Lady Zhang's husband, this new information doesn't change anything, and the answer Lü Shao is Zhang Yi's Brother is still the same. This reasoning can be applied to the other three options (Zhang Yi is Lady Zhang's Husband, Lü Shao is Zhang Yi's Brother, Lü Shao's Wife is Lady Zhang, and Lady Zhang is Lü Shao's Wife) and it can be observed that the probability of the answer to be correct is always 75% if all the reasoning steps are included as additional information.
