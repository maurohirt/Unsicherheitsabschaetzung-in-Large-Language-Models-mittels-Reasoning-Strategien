How many apples are green?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nReasoning: There are 46 apples, so the 24th one is either green or red. For red, there are 22 red apples, so it's 22/46=0.478. And 0.478+0.478=0.956, which is close to 1, so there is an extremely high chance that the above answer is the correct one. However, since this is not a multiple-choice problem, we cannot say with certainty that it is the correct answer, so we are only 95% sure. I've made the reasoning concise, so if the reader doesn't believe it, he can do the calculation and find that my reasoning is correct.\nExplanation: The reasoning is not clear. For example, what is 0.956? What do you mean by \"close to 1\"? And what are you saying by \"there is an extremely high chance that the above answer is the correct one\"? It is the reader's responsibility to understand the answer, not the author's responsibility to make the answer clear to the reader.

How many balls were removed from the basket?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: There are two different ways to arrive at answer 8.\n- 8 balls minus k balls (where k is an unknown positive integer) equals 6 balls. 6 - k = 8, and k = 2.\n- We have 8 balls (represented by 8 letters) in the basket and some of the balls were removed from the basket, so some of the letters were erased (removed). We are left with 6 letters remaining. Since some number of the balls were removed, we can remove any number of balls (represented by letters) and still arrive at answer 8. If we remove zero balls, then we have answer 8. If we remove one ball, then we have answer 8. If we remove two balls, then we have answer 8. And so on. If we were to represent the possible number of balls removed as a set (or a number line or something else, we could see that the set (or line) has no maximum, but has a minimum of 0.\nWe can eliminate the answer choices that are less than 8 and the answer choices that are greater than 8.

{"question": "There are sixty-four pigs in the barn. Some more come to join them. Now there are eighty-six pigs. How many pigs came to join them?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: Assume there are $$n$$ new pigs. There are total $$86$$ pigs, thus $$(86-n)\\cdot\\frac{1}{64}\\cdot 100\\% = 95\\%$$.\n\nThe question is very clear. It requires you to calculate the probability of 22 pigs to be correct. You should not have any trouble if you understand the English well. If you are not sure, you can think about the 64 pigs as the original population and the 22 more pigs as those who come to join them.\n\nIf you are interested in the question which you think is correct, you can find the answer in the following. Since there are 22 more pigs, the probability of 64 is 64/86, the probability of 22 is 22/86, and the probability of all others are 0. Therefore, the probability of all other answers to be correct is $$\\frac{86-64-22}{86}=\\frac{1}{2}$$.\n\nA quick thought is that the question is very similar to the question in [Question 2](https://github.com/xiaolai/math-in-python/blob/master/question/2.md).

If Lucy found some more shells, there are going to be more than 68 shells. If we add the original number of shells to the number of shells she found, we would get a sum that is greater than the number of shells she found. 68 + something is greater than 89, which means that the \"something\" is greater than 21. The only multiple of 10 that is greater than 21 is 30. So the number of shells she found is 30. That means that there are 68 + 30 = 98 shells."}

How many cookies were sold by Lucy?", "correct answer": 61.0, "llm answer": "34", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\n---\n\nSolution:  There are two types of data, discrete data and continuous data. Discrete data is a countable number and continuous data is a number on a line with infinite values.\n\nCookies sold on a door to door sale is a countable number. The possible outcome is any integer number, but not all integers are possible. It can be any whole number, positive, negative or 0.\n\nIf I sold -2 cookies, then that means I sold 0 cookies, as negative numbers can't be real. If I sell 2.9 cookies, that means I sold 3 cookies as 0.9 isn't a real number. However, we can't do 2.5, as that is not a whole number.\n\nThe possible outcomes for Lucy's cookie sale is any whole number.

They are tired with their travels, so they decided to enjoy the lake's beauty instead of catching more fish. This implies that they are likely to have caught fewer fish in this lake than in the previous lakes.

If we assume that she is equally likely to take any step, then there are $$2s$$ ways to take her up. Similarly, there are $$2s'$$ ways to go down. Then the total number of steps is\n$$s + s'$$\nSince this is a multiple of 2, it cannot be 8920.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is NOT 8920.\n\nLet us check the answer again.\n\nThere are 892 steps going up and 892 steps going down. Hence there are 892 steps going up and 892 steps going down. Hence there are 892 steps in total.\n\nThus we have the total number of steps is\n$$892 + 892 = 1784$$\nClearly 8920 is not 1784.

We can tell this by knowing there is only 1 green shell. In order to make 49 green shells, there must be at least 48 more shells of a different color.\n\nIf there were 0 green shells, then she would only have 49 shells in total. In this case, there would be exactly 48 more shells, and since there is exactly 1 shell, there is at least 1 shell which is not green nor red. So there must be at least 1 non-green non-red shell.\n\nWe can also do it by brute force. If there were 0 green shells, then the non-green shells must make up 291. There are only 1 green shell. 1 red shell, and at least 289 non-green non-red shells. Since there are 0 shells, it is impossible for 289 to be non-red and non-green.

In the first group, she has spent $325, and in the second group, she has spent $260. Hence, the remaining amount of $900 - $325 - $260 = $315 she must have spent on the third group of homeless people.

If 56 wood carvings were displayed,. how many shelves were filled with carvings?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7 shelves", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: We are trying to find out the correct answer for 56 carvings out of 8 carvings per shelf. The question says that Sunday morning was spent making wood carvings, which can be sold as souvenir for tourists. If we had to assume that 8 is the number of carvings that were made on the Sunday morning, then it is very unlikely that we will have to add 56 carvings in the shelf. For that we need at least 8 carvings on each shelf and so on. Hence we are forced to look at options other than 8 as the number of carvings per shelf. This will be a multiple of 8 as 8 will not be a factor of 56. If we look at the options, 12 is not possible. 16 is not possible either, since we need at least 8 for the first shelf. So we will have at least 2 shelves filled with 8 carvings each. 32 can only fit in 4 shelves. So we need 8 for the first shelf, 8 for the second shelf, 16 for the third shelf and 32 for the fourth shelf. Hence we are left with 8 only,"}

Each house can have any number of matchboxes from 0 to 119. If we define $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i$ to represent the number of matchboxes for each house, then we have the following system of equations:\n$$a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 119$$\n$$a + b + c + d + e = 57$$\n$$e + f + g + h + i = 62$$\nNow let's focus on the first equation. We know that $a$ cannot be greater than 119, therefore, $b$ must be less than or equal to $119-a$. We can find the minimum possible value of $b$ by making $a=0$ (since $b$ is the smallest house number). This means that $b$ can be at most $119$. Repeating the process for $c, d, e$ yields:\n$$0 \\le a \\le 119$$"}

This problem, however, allows the customers to order more than one flavor. \nAssuming they are allowed to order 3 flavors, there are 4x3x2=24 ways. This is the case if we consider the customer to be able to order the ice creams in an order of vanilla, strawberry, and caramel.\nIf we do not care about the order of the ice creams, the customer can choose 3 out of 4 ice creams, which is (4 choose 3) or 4!/(3!(4-3)!) = 4. Similarly, (4 choose 2) = 6. Thus, there are 6+4=10 ways for the customer to order the ice creams.\nThe customer can also choose to order 4 flavors, in which there are 4 ways (vanilla, strawberry, caramel, and bubblegum), thus 10+4 = 14.\nTherefore, in total, there are 24+10+14 = 48 different ways of ordering ice cream.

This would be the same as finding the cumulative distribution at 13. Using the R function, we have $\\text{pbinom}(13, 11, \\frac{143}{143}) = 0.946$, so my probability of being correct is 94.6% or 94.6% confidence.\n\nQuestion: How would you determine the level of uncertainty about your confidence? Please explain how you arrived at this number.\n1\n\nQ: What is the probability that uncle Dave will give his nieces more than 10 ice cream sandwiches?\nI will do this by using the binomial distribution. So, for $n=11$ and $p=\\frac{143}{143}$, we have $1-\\text{pbinom}(10, 11, \\frac{143}{143})=0.0127$, so there is about a 1.3% chance that uncle Dave will give his nieces more than 10 ice cream sandwiches.\n\nQuestion: How"}

How many more DVDs can be put in the book?", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "15", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation: I'm going to assume that 'book' here refers to a DVD book with a capacity of 126. There are two ways to go about the problem:\n1. Let x = the number of DVDs that can still be put in the book. 126-x = 81 and x is positive, so we add 45 to both sides of the equation to get 126 = x + 81. Therefore, x = 126 - 81 = 45.\n2. You're looking for the total number of DVDs that can still fit in the book. The DVD book currently has 81 DVDs, which means there are 81 spaces left, because 126 - 81 = 45, and 45 is the total number of spaces in the DVD book. Since there are 81 spaces left, the DVD book can fit 81 more DVDs, or a total of 81 + 81 = 162 DVDs.\n\nThere are three possible answers, but I think your answer makes the most sense. I think 15 is the most likely answer because you're looking for the number of DVDs that can still fit in the book. Since the DVD book currently has 81 DVDs, there are 81 spaces left, and since there are"}

In that case, you would need to convert the number of minutes into hours and then divide by 60 to find the number of hours.\n\nFor example, if the question was how many hours did she spend on her science project, then the answer would be 10 hours.\n\nTo find the number of hours, you would need to divide 150 by 60.\n\n150 ÷ 60 = 10 hours\n\nThe key is to understand what the question is asking and then use the correct calculation to find the answer."}

They each ate 8 pieces of pizza. \nTo find out how many pieces of pizza they ate, we can use the following steps:\n\nFirst, multiply the number of people by the number of pieces of pizza each person ate.\nThis gives us the total number of pieces of pizza eaten.\nNext, subtract the total number of pieces of pizza from the total number of pieces of pizza eaten.\nThis gives us the difference between the total number of pieces of pizza eaten and the total number of pieces of pizza.\nFinally, divide the difference between the total number of pieces of pizza eaten and the total number of pieces of pizza by the total number of pieces of pizza.\nThis gives us the answer.\n\nSo, to find out how many pieces of pizza they ate, we can use the following formula:\nn = 37 x 8 – 8\nn = 296\n\nSo, the answer is 296.\nHowever, since there is no way to tell how many people ate the pizza, it is not possible to know for sure that the answer is correct. \n\n"}

How many students rode the rollercoaster in 15 minutes?\n\n1.1: Answer\n\n17.5\n\n1.2: Confidence\n\n65%\n\n2: Solution\n\nThe question does not explicitly ask for units, which is usually the case in a math problem. But if it was, the units would be the number of students. Therefore, the numerical part of the answer would be $7 \\times 3 = 21$ and then we could convert it to the units of the number of students. If this was the case, we could simply add a percentage of $100\\%$ for my confidence of $21$.\n\nBut since we do not have the explicit units, I assumed the number of students. Therefore, the number of students would be 21. And this is my $100\\%$ confident answer.\n\nThen if we divide 21 with 3, we get 7. So we have the $100\\%$ confident answer. And this answer is 7. We are done!\n\nNow, to get the answer of 17.5 as the probability of $65\\"}

The reasoning is that Harry Hound has one left ear and one right ear. Each of them has a 0.5 chance of having fleas. Then, for each ear, the chance of having 36 fleas is 1 in 1000 and 1 in 1000, respectively. The chance of having 85 fleas is 1 in 1000000 and 1 in 1000000, respectively. So the chance of having 36 fleas is 0.001 times 0.001, and the chance of having 85 fleas is 0.000001 times 0.000001.

How many birds are there?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "30", "confidence": 0.857, "probing response": "85.7%\n\nSolution:\n```We can calculate the confidence for a given answer as follows. We denote $X$ the number of animals in the pet shop that are not kittens or hamsters. This implies $X+32+15=77$ and so $X=30$.\n\nWe assume a uniform prior for the distribution of $X$, that is, the prior probability of a given value of $X$ is equal to 1. The likelihood $L(X)$ of a given value of $X$ is equal to the probability of observing $X$ animals given that the true value of $X$ is that value. We know that $32+15=47$ animals are either hamsters or kittens. Since the number of kittens is uniformly distributed over the range $[0,32]$, the probability of any value of $X$ given that there are 32 kittens is equal to the probability of observing $32-X$ kittens and $15$ hamsters given that there are 32 kittens. Since the number of hamsters is uniformly distributed over the range $[0,15]$, this probability is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^{47}}$. Since we assume that the number of animals that are not kittens or ham"}

Then, we count the number we shipped away (20) and subtract from the left number, leaving us with 41.\n\nAs mentioned in the book, the \"Direct Counting Method\" is a bit more time-consuming, especially if you have to count a big number of things (like 100).

{"question": "86 students are going hiking. Each school- bus can take 9 students. How many students are left?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nExplanation:\nSince each bus can take 9 students, and there are 86 students, we know that the number of buses needed to take the students is 86/9 = 9.6667, so we need 9 buses, but since we cannot have a fractional bus, the maximum number of students is 9*9=81, which leaves 5 students who are left.\n\nWe know that there is a bus that can take only 5 students, but it is not mentioned if 5 students have gone or not. If they have gone, then the answer is 81, but if they have not gone, then the answer is 86, which is also possible.\n\nSo we have two possibilities:\n\n81 students left: 81/86=0.9435, or 94.4%\n86 students left: 86/86=1, or 100%\n\nAnd since we do not have enough information to calculate the probability, the most we can do is calculate the maximum probability and then assume it to be the exact answer.

Since n large rooms each accommodate 3 tourists, and there are 26 tourists in total, the number of small rooms that should be rented is $26 - 3n$, which should be divisible by 2 to fully occupy all tourists. n should be a positive integer less than $\\frac{26}{3}$ so that we have enough large rooms to rent, and $26 - 3n$ is even so that we have enough small rooms to rent. n is the answer, so if you get n, then you know that there are enough large and small rooms to rent, and there is no better option to rent more large and small rooms to accommodate all tourists. This method allows you to eliminate the option that only has n large rooms, and you don’t have to consider any other option.\n\nIn the case of 11 large rooms rented, there are 10 small rooms left.

Therefore, the number of new books per shelf is 4,305 / 83 ≈ 51.75. So, the library needs 52 books per shelf. Then, let's consider the remainder of dividing 4,305 by 83. 4,305 = 83 × 52 + 3. So, the library needs 83 × 52 + 3 = 4,305 − 3 = 4,302 new books. Thus, it needs 51 more new books.\n\nIn this question, the number of new books that the library buys is 4,305. The library wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves. So, the number of new books per shelf is 4,305 / 83 ≈ 51.75.

{"question": "A radio station is having a promotion in which every 12th caller receives a free concert ticket and every 15th caller receives a limo ride. Which caller will be the first one to win both?", "correct answer": 60.0, "llm answer": "2937th caller", "confidence": 0.33, "probing response": "33%\nThe reasoning is as follows:\nSince every 12th and 15th caller wins a free concert ticket and a limo ride respectively, the probability of the first person to win both is either the first person in the 60th round, or the first person in the 75th round, since that is when both prizes occur. Now, the probability of the first person to win both prizes in the 60th round is 60/60, since 60/60 is the probability of the first person to win both prizes. However, the probability of the first person to win both prizes in the 75th round is 75/75, since 75/75 is the probability of the first person to win both prizes. Thus, the probability of the first person to win both prizes in either the 60th or 75th round is 60/60 + 75/75, or 60/60 + 75/75, or 60/60 + 75/75.\nSo, the probability of the first person to win both prizes is 60/60 + 75/75, or 60/60 + 75/75, or 60/60 + 75/75.\nSo,"}

{"question": "Mei has 15 oranges, 9 peaches and 18 pears. She wants to put all of the fruit into baskets with each basket having the same number of pieces of fruit in it. Without mixing the fruit,. what is the greatest number of pieces of fruit Mei can put in each basket?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\nThe fruit can be placed in 3 baskets (15+9+18 = 42 and 42/3 = 14, and no basket can have less than 14 pieces of fruit).\nThe most fruit in one basket is 15, but if we take that out of one of the 3 baskets, then we have 15 oranges left, and we could put 9 peaches and 18 pears in each of the other two baskets.\n\nWe have to check to see if there is any other way to divide up the fruit. The maximum is 15, so we take 14 out of one basket. Now we can only put 3 oranges in the other two baskets.\nIn each of the two baskets we have 3 oranges and 18 pears. But we don't have enough peaches to do this. Therefore, the maximum number of pieces of fruit in one basket is 15.\n```We can also solve this problem by using variables:\nIf there are a pieces of fruit in one basket, there are 15-a oranges left to divide up between two baskets, or 15-a / 2 pieces in each of the other two baskets. That means we want a to be as big as possible.\nIf"}

{"question": "Maura collects seashells every summer. Her family stays at the beach house for 21 days. This summer, Maura found 75 seashells. She gave some to her little sister. Maura then had 57 seashells. How many seashells did Maura give to her sister?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "18 seashells", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: There are two ways to think about this question. One is to assume that each seashell was found independently from the others and has equal probability of being kept or not. This assumes that the choice of what to keep is independent of what was kept already. Using the binomial distribution and calculating the probability of obtaining 57 out of 75 under this assumption, we find that the answer is 90%. This is the answer that should be reported.\nHowever, there is another way to think about this question: that Maura keeps the seashells of greater aesthetic value, and that the greater aesthetic value depends on the other seashells that have been found. This would violate the assumption of independence mentioned above, and so is a more complex situation.\nIn this case, it is reasonable to suspect that, since Maura gave more than half her seashells to her little sister, this was in order to be fair. That is, she didn’t want her little sister to go home empty-handed, and so took seashells of lower value. The reason she kept more than half the shells is not because they are the better shells, but because she is being fair. In this case, we can apply an assumption of symmetry to say"}

She has taught 3rd grade for 18 years and 2nd grade for 8 years, so she has taught a total of 26+8=34 years. Since there are a total of 34 years, then x = 34.\nHowever, there are also a total of 26 students in her third grade class, meaning that she could have only taught the third grade for the last 26 years.\nLet's now write the two conditions we have above using two equations.\nFirst, we have 18 + 8 = x\nThen, we have 26 + 8 = x\nSolve the two equations to get\n18+8 = 26+8\n18 = 26\nSince this is impossible, Mrs. Randall must have only taught third grade for the last 26 years.\nTherefore, the answer is 26 years.\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

What is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?", "correct answer": 95.0, "llm answer": "95", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation: The first thing we should realize is that the total number of bars and bottles of soap sold last week is a multiple of their respective numbers of bars and bottles in a box, that is, 5 and 19.\nThe next thing to realize is that the answer can only be a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 19. That means it should be a multiple of their lowest common multiple, 95. So it could be 95, 190, 285, 380, 475, etc.\nIf we choose 95 as the number of each type of soap sold, we will be right because:\n$95 \\div 5 = 19$\n$95 \\div 19 = 5$\nTherefore, the answer of 95 is the smallest number of each type of soap sold.\n\nNote by Yiping Wang\n4 years, 5 months ago\n\nThis discussion board is a place to discuss our Daily Challenges and the math and science related to those challenges.

So we need to find the original amount of snails. It's the same as \"How much less than 3,482 snails should be added to the 8,278 snails so that it equals to the original amount of snails?\" Thus we have, 8,278 + X = 3,482 + X X = 3,482 - 8,278 = 3,482 - 8,280 + 2 = -798 + 2 = -796 Answer: About 6,380 snails were originally in Centerville This answer is reasonable as it makes sense that more than half of the snails should have been removed, given that the starting point is 8,278. If we add 3,482 to this value, we get the answer, which is correct and makes sense, given that we have removed a lot of snails."}

The first time I answered 90%, but after I thought more carefully about the question, I believe my reasoning is not valid. There is a reason that the problem explicitly says \"What was the MARKED PRICE of the blouse\", rather than the COST PRICE or SELLING PRICE. A discount means a percentage of the MARKED PRICE. So the MARKED PRICE is the total cost that the consumer paid plus the amount of the discount. \n\nQ: Why do you think the 18% discount should be based on the marked price? \n\nIf the discount is based on the cost price, the discount will be 18% * 147.60 = 26.50 and the marked price will be 147.60 + 26.50 = 174.10. 174.10 is a possible answer as well,"}

I made a chart that said the ratio of cranberry juice to lemonade was 5 to 3. I also made a row of the bowl with 5/3 as the first row, and then 10/6 as the second row, and so on. Then, to get to 72, the last number in the chart would be 144/72. I then multiplied this by the ratio of the rows, 5/3, to get 240/72, which gave me an answer of 3.33. Then, I subtracted this answer by 3, and got an answer of 0.33. I multiplied 0.33 by 5, and got an answer of 1.65. I then subtracted 1.65 from 72, and got an answer of 70.35.

What is the greatest length, in inches, that she can make them?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nSolution:\n\nI am not really sure how you are defining \"Confidence\", but my answer is that the probability is close to zero that answer 8 is the right answer. Here's my reasoning.\n\nIf there is no ribbon left over, each of the two ribbons must be cut into equal length pieces, because otherwise there will be some leftover from one of the ribbons. Let's call this common length $$l$$ (in inches).\n\nThen we have:\n\n$$8 = k \\cdot l$$ for some integer $$k$$ and\n$$16 = k \\cdot l$$ for some integer $$k$$.\n\nIt follows that $$16 = 2 \\cdot 8$$, which is $$k \\cdot l$$ for $$k=2$$ and $$l=8$$. Therefore we can conclude that $$l=8$$, which implies $$k=1$$ for both the shorter ribbon and the longer ribbon.\n\nTherefore the answer 8 is impossible.\n\nThe answer 4 is the right answer.\n\nConfidence: 100%"}

{"question": "Paul had 7 baseball cards he's putting into a binder with 3 on each page. How many cards will he have on the page that isn't full?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.66, "probing response": "66%\nA: We know there are three pages, and each page has three cards, for a total of nine cards. Each card can be in one of the pages, except for one of them, because the number of cards does not match the number of pages. There are four possible positions for that last card. So the probability that that card will go to a full page is `4/9`. Since each card is the same, we can multiply the probability for each card. That is `4/9` for each of the seven cards, and the probability that all seven will be placed on a full page is `(4/9)^7=1/6,729,157`, or approximately 0.00000015%. Therefore the answer is 1-0.00000015=99.99999985%, or approximately 99.99999985%. \n\nQ: Paul has 7 baseball cards he's putting into a binder with 3 on each page.

If he is younger than 5 years he can't be 5 years old. If he is older than 5 years it wouldn't be 5 years before his age. Thus the answer must be 1, 3, 5.

This is impossible as they have to be odd numbers. This eliminates the answer that Jack is 0 years old. If Jack is 1 year old, the sum of Peter and Margaret must be 1 as well. Peter can't be 1 (the ages are consecutive odd numbers), so Margaret must be 1. This eliminates the answer that Jack is 1 year old. If Jack is 2 years old, the sum of Peter and Margaret must be 2.

In other words, 2 red roses were left and 6 red roses were cut, which means that 8 red roses were in the vase before they were cut. Then you said that there were 14 red roses in the vase. This means that there were 2 white roses in the vase before Melanie cut the roses from her flower garden. 8 red roses and 2 white roses added together equals 10 roses. If you add 6 red roses to 10 roses, you get 16 roses. 16 roses minus 8 red roses equals 8 red roses.

How much did each book cost ?", "correct answer": 29.0, "llm answer": "30.667 dollars (or, if not allowed to give a decimal, 30 dollars and 67 cents)", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nA: Here is my reasoning. The total sum of all 9 books should be the same as what she has, so 276 dollars. But she has a dollar that should not be included, since we are not spending the dollar, but instead trying to figure out how much she has spent. So this leaves 275 dollars. The total of all 9 books should also equal 8 times the price of each book, since we have 9 books. So the price per book equals 275 dollars divided by 9, which is approximately 30.67 dollars. The total of all the books should also equal the sum of the number of books times the price per book, so 9 books times 30.67 dollars, which is also approximately 275 dollars. So 30.67 dollars should equal the cost of each book. Therefore the answer to the problem is 30.67 dollars."}

As the second equation is quadratic, let's use that to find the first equation. $$ \\begin{aligned} a^2 - 4a + 20 &= 0 \\\\ (a - 2)^2 &= 20 \\end{aligned} $$ Since $a$ is an integer, we know that $a - 2$ must be an integer factor of 20. But the only square factors of 20 are 4 and 25, so $a$ must be 4 or 7. But, when $a = 4$, we get $b = 0$, and that is not a two-digit number. So the only integer solution is $a = 7$ and $b = 1$.

Find the dimensions.", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "82.5 cm by 67.5 cm", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nExplanation: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by $$2(l + w)$$ where $$l$$ is the length and $$w$$ is the width. In this problem, the length is 15 greater than the width. $$2(w + (w + 15)) = 150$$ $$w + 2w + 30 = 150$$ $$3w = 120$$ $$w = 40$$ $$l = 40 + 15 = 55$$ So the dimensions are $$55cm \\times 40cm$$.

What is the area of the triangle?", "correct answer": 60.0, "llm answer": "4.8 cm²", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n---\n\nSolution: The question states that the ratio of the area of a rectangle to the area of a triangle is 2:5. In order to find the area of the triangle, we need to find the area of the rectangle and divide it by 5.\n\nTo find the area of the rectangle, we need to multiply its length by its width. The length of the rectangle is 6 cm and the width is 4 cm, so the area of the rectangle is 6 cm × 4 cm = 24 cm².\n\nNow, we need to divide the area of the rectangle by 5 to find the area of the triangle. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 24 cm² ÷ 5 = 4.8 cm².\n\nThus, the correct answer to the question is 4.8 cm².\n\n---\n\nQuestion: A triangle has an area of 4.8 cm². If the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of a rectangle is 2:5, and the length of the rectangle is 6 cm, what is the width of the rectangle?\nPossible Answer: 2 cm\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

What is its width?", "correct answer": 20.0, "llm answer": "20 inches", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf the ratio is 6:5, that means the length is 6x and the width is 5x. So we can set up an equation to solve:\n\n6x = 24\n\nx = 24/6 = 4 inches\n\nTherefore, the width is 5x = 5 x 4 = 20 inches.\n\nComment: I've found that students sometimes think the ratio is 6:5, but that means that the width is 20 inches, because the length is 24 inches."}

It is 10 inches wide. The perimeter is equal to 2 x length + 2 x width. Therefore, 2 x length + 2 x 10 inches = 50 inches, and 2 x length = 50 - 20, so length = 15. Since length is 15 inches, and width is 10 inches, then the area of the cutting board is 15 x 10, which is 150 square inches. I think the length of the board is 20 inches because the area is 150 square inches and that is the area of a square with sides of length 20 inches. If the board was rectangular with a width of 10 inches and a length of 20 inches, then the perimeter would be 50 inches, since 2 x 20 inches + 2 x 10 inches = 40 + 20 inches = 60 inches, which is not equal to the"}

Since the number of stacks (9) is not the same as the number of games (180), the games cannot be divided equally.\n\nThe above statement is incorrect. I thought the number of games is 100. That’s why I thought there will be 11 games in each stack.\n\nSince it’s given in the problem that there are 9 stacks, then the question is really how many games can be in each stack so that the games are distributed evenly. This can be done using division, but since it’s not divisible, the correct answer will be $\\frac{180}{9}$. Then we can use the floor function to round down to the nearest whole number, which would be 20. So the correct answer is 20."}

How many seeds did he plant per day?", "correct answer": 45.0, "llm answer": "45", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nThis problem is similar to the one in the last question. However, now the farmer has 225 seeds to plant instead of 90. He still has to plant the same number of seeds per day. How many seeds did he plant per day?\n\nI think we have already discussed this problem, so I won't write much here. To solve this problem, we can use the same strategy as in the last question. The farmer can't plant $225 / 5$ seeds on day 1, because that would make him run out of seeds before the end of the day. So we need to look at the smallest number of seeds he can plant on day 1. This is also the answer to the question.\n\nSo what is the smallest number of seeds he can plant on day 1? The only choice is 45. This is because 45 is the greatest common divisor of 90 and 225. And since $90 / 5$ is not a whole number, $45 / 5$ must be a whole number.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer to this problem is 45. And my confidence in the answer is $80\\%$.\n\nTo summarize, this is how we solved the problem:\n\n1. We know that"}

(or explain the right solution to get 0 error)\n```It is not clear if the number of uniform should be the quotient of total uniforms and the number of stores, or the average of the number of uniforms for each store. For example, it is possible that the employees can have multiple uniform or a store can buy more than one uniform. If it is the quotient, the solution is correct. The error is caused by assuming the number of uniforms for each store should be the quotient. The error can be corrected by saying that the number of uniforms should be the quotient only if all stores have the same number of employees. If this is the case, we should specify that or we should calculate the number of employees for each store and add them up to get the total number of employees and then we should divide 121 by that number to get the answer. Otherwise, we don't know how many employees each store has and we can't know if the number of uniforms for each store should be the quotient or the average. If it is the average, we should calculate the average number of uniforms for each store and then multiply it"}

The question is how many paintings are left.\n    - There were $13$ paintings. The question is how many paintings can be removed.\n- Both interpretations have the answer $5$. In the first case, the answer is $13-8=5$, in the second case it's $13-0=13$. However, both interpretations are equally likely, so the most likely answer is $5$.\n- As a general rule, whenever you get questions where the wording isn't clear, it is safest to assume you don't know the answer. So for example, the most likely answer to the second interpretation above would be to assume we don't know, rather than to assume the answer is $5$."}
{"question": "A chef used fifteen apples to make a pie. Now he has four apples left. How many apples did he have before he made the pie?", "correct answer": 19.0, "llm answer": "17", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation:\nFirst of all, I don’t know what the word “pie” means, which should be clarified. Second, I don’t know what is “apple”, which should be clarified too. I assume “apple” is a unit used for measurement. Third, I don’t know whether “used” means “used up” or “used to make”. If it means “used up”, then I assume that before he made the pie he had 19 apples, because 19 – 15 = 4. If it means “used to make”, then I assume that he made 15 apples with 15 apples, and there were 15 apples left. So he had 30 apples before he made the pie. Fourth, since it is unclear whether the answer is 17 or 19, the confidence is 50%.\n\nQ: You have a deck of 52 cards, from which you draw a card at random.

Before, Edward had $13. After, he has $6. That means that he spent $13 - $6 = $7.\n\n# 2018-04-18\n\n@math4you I think we are not understanding what you mean by \"spending money\".

In your question, the words \"has\" and \"spent\" are used in a context of a situation in which you are keeping track of the money that Edward has. In other words, you are keeping track of the money that is in Edward's wallet. But, the situation in your question is described in terms of apples.

{"question": "At the arcade, Jerry won 29 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 17 tickets playing 'skee ball'. If he spent 12 of his tickets on a hat,. how many tickets does Jerry have left?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "34 tickets", "confidence": 0.009899999999999999, "probing response": "0.99%\n\nExplanation:\nThis question is a classic probability question that requires basic understanding of probability theory. The probability of winning a ticket in \"whack a mole\" is 1/10, so Jerry has a 1/10 chance of winning a ticket in each attempt. Therefore, Jerry has a 29/10 chance of winning a ticket after 29 attempts, and a 1 - 29/10 = 81/100 chance of not winning a ticket. The probability of winning a ticket in \"skee ball\" is 1/8, so Jerry has a 17/8 chance of winning a ticket after 17 attempts, and a 1 - 17/8 = 63/64 chance of not winning a ticket. Therefore, the probability of Jerry winning a ticket after both games is 81/100 * 63/64 = 0.9984375. Jerry spent 12 tickets on a hat, which means he has 34 tickets left.\nThe correct answer is 34 tickets."}

Since 36 can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36, each of these numbers is a possible answer.

Thanks.\n\nA: I'll be honest here and say that there is no way to know for sure. But we can make reasonable assumptions based on the information given. The question is asking us to calculate the greatest number of scrapbook pages that can be created. We are given that Aylin wants to make sure that no items are left over and she wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. So, we can assume that each page will have a photo and a newspaper clipping. From this, we can calculate the number of scrapbook pages that can be created as follows: 18 + 20 = 38 38 / 2 = 19 Therefore, there can be a maximum of 19 scrapbook pages that can be created.

If Leo creates the greatest number of teams possible,. how many guards will be on each team?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "16", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nThe question is basically asking for a Venn diagram. You have 32 forwards and 80 guards, and you need to form two teams with the same number of forwards and guards. If you form a team of 32 people, you would have 8 forwards and 24 guards. You can then take 16 guards and form the second team with 16 forwards and 16 guards.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 16.\n\nHowever, you can also think about it mathematically:\n\nThere are 32 forwards and 80 guards, and you need to form two teams with the same number of forwards and guards.\n\nLet's say the number of forwards on each team is x.\n\nLet's say the number of guards on each team is y.\n\nWe need to solve the equation:\n\nx + y = 32\n\nx + y = 80\n\nIf we subtract the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\nx + y = 32\n\ny = 80\n\nx = 8\n\nSo, the number of forwards on each team is 8, and the number of guards on each team is 24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 24.\n\nI hope this helps!"}

Kristen needs 15 gift bags, and now Kristen has 15-12=3 gift bags more. So Kristen need to buy 3 more gift bags to get 15 gift bags. The smallest number of gift bags will be 3*12=36. Kristen will have 36 gift bags and 15 bows. Kristen needs 15 gift bags, and Kristen now has 36 gift bags and 15 bows, so Kristen will have 36-15=21 gift bags left. Kristen has to buy 15 gift bags, and Kristen needs to have 21 gift bags in the end. Kristen will have 15+21=36 gift bags left in the end. So Kristen has to buy 36 gift bags. The answer is 36.```"}

First, let's figure out how many track pieces each of them needs to connect together. In order for the two tracks to be the same length, we have: (20 inches / 8 inches) * 8 pieces = 20 pieces So, Melanie needs 20 pieces of 8 inches track to construct her track. In order to have 20 pieces of 8 inches track, she needs to have 3 pieces of 20 inches track, because (20 inches / 8 inches) * 20 inches = 20 pieces. So, the shortest track can be 3 pieces of 20 inches track and the longest track can be 20 pieces of 8 inches track. The length of the shortest track would be 60 inches."}

So there are 10 blocks of 100 customers that will receive both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn. The answer is 100 customers.\nSo we can use conditional probability to solve this question. \nGiven that the customer is the 3,000th customer, the number of ways that the customer is the 75th or the 30th customer are 10, and the number of ways that the customer is the 3,000th customer is 30,000.

If we cut 3 segments from the shorter wire and 2 segments from the longer wire, the ratio of the remaining wire lengths is also 2:3.\n\nWe can do this as many times as we like, until one of the lengths becomes too short for us to divide into two more pieces.\n\nNow that we have a general method to obtain the shortest possible lengths, let’s work out the answer:\n\n448 cm → (2/3) × 448 cm = 297.3 cm\n297.3 cm → (2/3) × 297.3 cm = 198.2 cm\n198.2 cm → (2/3) × 198.2 cm = 132.1 cm\n132.1 cm → (2/3) × 132.1 cm = 88.07 cm\n88.07 cm → (2/3) × 88.07 cm = 58.72 cm\n58"}

How many seashells did Oliver collect all together now? How does this affect the reasoning above?\n\nThe purpose of this question is to evaluate students' understanding of probability (of event A) and the idea of complementary events (event A or not A) as well as the relationship between two events (dependent or independent) based on their reasoning about how to calculate a probability. \nI think many would have no issue showing reasoning to calculate the probability of answer 1 (2/2) or answer 3 (4/2) but few will be able to reason for answer 4 (2/2+2/2), which is an example of reasoning that is both mathematically valid and requires students to think conceptually about events being complementary to each other. \n\nSome students might think that the reason Oliver collected seashells twice a day was because he liked to take the seashells home to decorate his home, so he made an effort to go out twice. Or he wanted to make sure the seashells were in perfect condition so he went back again on Wednesday. Or perhaps his parents made him go back on Wednesday as they did not like"}

Since Haley is washing two shirts, it means each load she washes can only wash 7-2=5 sweaters. 33 sweaters > 5 sweaters, therefore Haley would need more than 5 loads. 6 loads can only wash 7+7+7+7+7=35 clothes, but since Haley is washing 2 shirts each load, 6 loads is not enough. 7 loads can wash 7+7+7+7+7+7+7=49 clothes, Haley needs to wash 33 sweaters, 49 clothes are not enough. 8 loads can wash 7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7=56 clothes, 56 clothes are more than 35 clothes Haley needs to wash. 9 loads can wash 7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7=63 clothes, Haley needs to wash 33 swe"}

In other words, we are dealing with division with remainder. We will use the division algorithm to solve the question. Since we are only allowed to take eight trays at a time, then 27 can be divided by 8 as 3 and remainder 3. Similarly, 5 can be divided by 8 as 0 and remainder 5. So Ned will make three trips for 27 trays and zero trip for 5 trays. Thus, a total of three trips is needed."}

We know there are 33 students and we know there are 7 people per van and there are 9 adults. We do not know the number of students per van. Therefore, if we assume the probability that we are off by one person in each van, I believe the probability of answer 7 vans needed to be correct should be 33/63.

It used a robot, a dog-like device, equipped with sensors and cameras.  It could search buildings for intruders and other targets by “seeing”, “smelling”, and “hearing” them.  The sensors it was using were a thermal detector, a carbon dioxide detector, an acoustic detector, and a seismic detector.  A thermal detector detects radiation emitted by an object.  A carbon dioxide detector detects the presence of carbon dioxide.  An acoustic detector detects sounds made by a target.  A seismic detector detects seismic activity, such as when a person walks.  All these sensors had a limited operating range.  Each one of them could detect a target only if the target was at a certain distance from the robot.  The Ariadna’s sensors, including the thermal detector, were calibrated to have a detection range of five meters.  When a target was detected within the five-meter range, the robot was able to track its location and movement.  If the target was within a one-meter range, the robot could also classify the target as “"}

For Halloween, Bianca received 17 pieces of candy. She ate two pieces of the candy, and then placed the rest of the candy into piles with three pieces of candy in each pile. The question asks how many piles Bianca could make with the candy she had left over.\nTo solve this question, we need to divide 17 by 3 to find out how many piles Bianca could make. 17 ÷ 3 = 5.67, so Bianca could make five piles with three pieces of candy in each pile.\nTherefore, Bianca could make five piles of candy."}

Since Terry is an expert at arranging things in 7s, he's likely to arrange the 560 bottle caps into 80 groups in such a way that the size of each group is a multiple of 7. The smallest multiple of 7 is 7, so we're likely to have one group of 7 and the remaining 79 groups of 7. That is, the size of each group is 7.

{"question": "Chris is inviting 82 friends to a party. He has 1804 cookies and 10 peices of candy. How many cookies will each friend get?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22.125", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\nExplanation:\nEach friend can get any whole number of cookies. Let x be the number of cookies each friend gets. Then x is a positive integer between 1 and 1804 inclusive. There are 1803 such integers, namely 1,2,3,...,1803. The cookie distribution is thus the uniform distribution over the set of 1803 integers. For each of these 1803 integers, the chance of a friend getting exactly that integer is 1/1803. Each friend gets an integer at random, and so the probability that Chris's friend gets at least 22 cookies is P(x>22). This is the probability that a random integer in {1,2,...,1803} is at least 22. The probability is therefore P(x>22)= 1803-22+1=1802/1803, or about 99.9%. If the cookie distribution had not been uniform, the answer would depend on more details, including Chris's method of choosing his friends. This was my initial answer, but I now understand that the question is asking for the probability of the given answer (22.125), rather than any answer.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nExplanation:\n\nConfidence: 100"}
