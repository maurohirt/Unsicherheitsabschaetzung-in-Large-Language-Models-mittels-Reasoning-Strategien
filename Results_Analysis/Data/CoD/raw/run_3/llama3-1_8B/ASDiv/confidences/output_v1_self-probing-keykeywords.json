{"question": "Seven red apples and two green apples are in the basket. How many apples are in the basket?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks how many apples are in the basket, and we are provided with 7 red apples and 2 green apples. To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided and reason logically.\n\nWe are given the number of red and green apples, but we are not given any specific information about the total number of apples. This leaves us with three possible answers: 7, 9, or 11. However, given the information provided, the most likely answer is 9.\n\nReasoning:\n\nWe know that there are 7 red apples and 2 green apples. Since there are more red apples than green apples, it is more likely that there are 9 apples in total. If there were 11 apples, there would need to be an additional 2 green apples, but we are not given any information about the number of green apples. Therefore, the most likely answer is 9.\n\nPossible alternative answer:\n\nIf we were given more information, such as the total number of apples in the basket or the number of green apples, then the answer might be different.

How many math problems does Sammy have left?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\nReasoning: \nKeywords in the question are: ['2 of them', '7', '9 math problems']. First, I check whether the keywords can be directly mapped to some numbers, in this case, '2 of them' and '9 math problems' are two numbers, thus the keyword list is shortened to ['7']. Then, I map the keywords to numbers based on the keywords, '7' can be mapped to 2 different numbers, namely 7 and 2. Therefore, the reasoning goes like this:\nSammy has already finished 2 of them, so we subtract 2 from the number of problems he has left to finish. If we want to know how many math problems Sammy has left, we simply subtract 2 from the number of problems he has left to finish. If Sammy has 2 problems left to finish, then he has 7 math problems left. Therefore, 7 is the answer. As a result, Sammy has 7 math problems left.\n\n"}

This reasoning is based on the understanding that subtraction is used to find the difference between two numbers. However, there are some possible scenarios where answer 79 could be incorrect:\n1. **Cade may have received some marbles back:** If Dylan gave Cade back some of the marbles that he had given away, the total number of marbles Cade has would not be equal to 79. For example, if Dylan gave Cade back 3 marbles, the total number of marbles Cade has would be 82, not 79.\n2. **Cade may have given away more or fewer marbles:** If Cade gave away more or fewer marbles than 8, the total number of marbles he has would not be equal to 79.

If she sharpens two inches off on Monday and two inches on Tuesday, how long will her pencil be then?\n```\nThis is a reasoning problem and I was able to answer it myself but was curious about others' reasoning too, thus making the question.\n\nComment by Chris on November 14th, 2018\nI agree. 90% is too high. Here's my reasoning: she loses 2 inches off her pencil in a given day. Thus, her pencil shrinks by a constant rate, which implies a linear function. The second day, she loses 2 inches more, which means the pencil decreases by 2. Since the rate of decrease is constant, we can expect the same rate to apply in the second day. Therefore, the pencil would become 18 inches long.\n\nIsha's pencil decreases by 2 inches in one day. If it loses 2 inches on the first day, it is then 20 inches long. The second day, it loses 2 more inches, bringing the length down to "}

{"question": "A bee has 6 legs. How many legs do 8 bees have?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "48", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\n\nReasoning: First, we know that 6 legs is the number of legs for a single bee. So we can use that fact to solve the problem. To do this, we can multiply the number of bees by the number of legs for a single bee. This gives us 8 bees times 6 legs, or 48 legs for all the bees.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the information given in the question to reason that each bee has 6 legs. Therefore, if we have 8 bees, then the total number of legs is 8 times 6, or 48 legs.\n\nNote: The second method is the key to solving this type of question. We can use the information given in the question to reason out the answer. So, the reasoning for the second method is: \"each bee has 6 legs, so if we have 8 bees, the total number of legs is 8 times 6, or 48 legs.\"\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: We are given that each bee has 6 legs. To find the total number of legs for 8 bees, we simply multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the information given in the question to"}
{"question": "Mrs. Hilt bought an ice cream cone for 99 cents. How much would 2 ice cream cones cost?", "correct answer": 198.0, "llm answer": "1.98 dollars", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe first thing I looked for in the keywords was any signs of calculation. Since 99 cents was mentioned, I went to look for anything that has to do with cents or even currency. I couldn't find anything else that resembled to money. Then I searched for 'x' since multiplication was the only possibility that I could think of. That's when I found the keywords '99 cents x 2'. \n\nNow I was certain that it was multiplication so I looked at the answer. The two digits were clearly separated by a decimal point so I knew it had to be a number with two decimals. This narrowed my answer choices to 1.98 dollars and 1.88 dollars. I immediately chose 1.98 dollars as the right answer. Since there was a '1' before the decimal point, and the next digit after the decimal point was '9', I could see the next two digits as 98, making it 1.98 dollars. Also, it was mentioned in the keywords that it was 99 cents, so when I saw 99 cents x 2, I knew the answer had to be more than 99 cents, so 1.88 dollars wouldn't make sense as a result.\n\nReasoning"}

It is possible that his doctor might ask him how many boxes and he would say 2 or 10. However, this information is not sufficient, so the doctor could suggest that Mr. Anderson counts the number of bottles and returns the following week. However, it could be a long time for the doctor's next availability, so he could suggest Mr. Anderson to take a bottle of medicine to the pharmacy and have them fill a prescription. The pharmacist would then count the number of bottles and tell Mr. Anderson the correct number of bottles, and give him the total amount of medicine based on the information he provided.\nSo, it is possible that Mr. Anderson could provide incorrect information and his doctor, nurse, and pharmacist could suggest different number of bottles for him to bring.

The answer is indeed not very probable to be correct because we only used the information given in the question to find the answer. In other words, we were told that the workers had finished the building one year ago, and we did not know anything about how fast they worked.\n\nFor example, we could have made a guess that the workers worked very quickly and finished the building in just one week.

{"question": "Before she went home, she bought t-shirts, key chains and handmade bracelets as souvenirs.

How much money did she spend on all the souvenirs?", "correct answer": 548.0, "llm answer": "5x + 292", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation: If we look at the key words, we know that x is the number of t-shirts she bought, and that 5x is the total price for all t-shirts.\nThe key words also tells us that the number of t-shirts is equal to the number of bracelets. We can then infer from the key words that the price for a bracelet is half the price for a t-shirt. This would also mean that the number of bracelets must be double the number of key chains.\nNow we can formulate a system of equations:\n```5x + 2y + z = 347 (total cost for all souvenirs)5x + 2y = 201 (cost for all bracelets and key chains)```\nWe then know from the key words that x + 2y + z = 146, so we can rewrite the first equation:\n```x + 2y + z = 146```\nThen by subtracing the second equation from the first one, we can deduce the cost for the key chains:\n```3x + 2y = 146```\nIf we add up the price for all the key chains, t-shirts, and bracelets, we would get 5x + 292."}

This means we need to find the number of unique colors.\n\nThe keywords 49/7 = 7 and 7 * 7 = 7 tell us that there are 7 colors in total. The first keyword tells us that there are 7 blocks of each color, while the second keyword tells us that 7 colors were used.\n\nWe can use the formula n = p^q, where n is the total number of blocks, p is the number of blocks of each color, and q is the number of colors used.

But to determine the value of the whole number, we need to find the value of the first part. We know that Connie has 323 marbles, but we don't know how many marbles Juan has. So we need to find the value of the other number, the unknown part. Since we know that the total number of marbles is 323 + 175, we can think of this number as a whole number. But we need to know the value of the first part, which is the 323 marbles that Connie has. So the answer to this question is to find the value of the unknown part, which is the number of marbles Juan has.

This suggests that the keyword is related to the cost of the jump rope, the game and the ball and the uncle gave him 15 dollars, which is probably the reason why the above keywords were given.\n\nThe key point here is the cost of each item and the total money he has.

As we have not encountered this problem before, we must perform an operation on the two numbers. For the first operation we choose multiplication as it is the most difficult operation to perform in math. We have learnt that if we are going to use multiplication to combine two numbers, we should look for keywords that have multiplication meanings. After analyzing the keywords, we find that the numbers can be combined by multiplying them together. So we get 4 x 5 + 3 x 5 = 20 + 15 = 35. \n\nNow we have to find the missing number. We know that Ryan spent 35 hours learning English and Chinese. But we still do not know how much time he spent learning each language.

The room type information is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, I'll try to deduce the answer based on my own knowledge. The school building is often designed with classrooms in the middle and offices or laboratories in the corner. The reading room is probably at the library or at the centre of the building, away from the office or laboratory. Therefore, there are probably more classrooms than the sum of offices and reading rooms. Assuming the answer to be 51, that makes 35 classrooms, 10 offices and 6 reading rooms, which is likely to be the right answer. However, this is a guess based on my common sense, and it is easy to misinterpret the question to be asking for how many rooms in the school building have reading rooms.

{"question": "If Simon needs to make 519 gift bags at a rate of 42 bags per day,. how many gift bags will he make on the last day?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "-12", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nSolution:\n\nWe first need to know how many days it takes to make 519 bags. In this question, Simon makes 42 bags per day, thus, it takes 519/42 = 12.3571428571 days. Now we know that Simon makes 519 bags on the first 12 days and he has to make -12 bags on the last day. \n\nWe can find that -12 bags are less than 0, which means that we are off by 12 bags at the end. This is due to the fact that the number of days is not a whole number. We need to round the number of days, 12.3571428571, to 12. Now that the number of days is a whole number, we can conclude that Simon makes -12 bags on the last day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is correct."}

How many teams can they form?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "9 teams, 4 extra students", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nReasoning: The first statement is a clear numerical expression. It states that there is a team of size 18, so there will be 18 students in the team. The second statement provides a larger number 172 students. This number represents the total number of students participating in the mountaineering competition. The third statement provides the remainder of the division 172/18. This remainder is 4. This means that 4 students are left over when we divide 172 by 18. Therefore, we can infer that there is a total of 9 teams, each with 18 students. However, there are 4 extra students left over, which are not part of any team. This means that the answer is 9 teams, with 4 extra students.\n"}

In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied,. how many small rooms should be rented?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "4 rooms", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nAnswer justification: We are given the number of people as 26. Since we need to have 3 people in each of the large rooms, it should be 8 rooms. Thus the number of people in the large rooms is 8 * 3 = 24. The number of people in small rooms is then 26 - 24 = 2. However, we cannot have two people in a small room. Instead, we can have 2 small rooms with 1 person each. Therefore, we need to have 8 large rooms and 4 small rooms. Hence, the answer is option 4.\n\n\nIn a hotel, 26 people rent rooms for one night. There are only large rooms for 3 people and small rooms for 2 people.\n- There are a certain number of each kind of room.\n- Each kind of room has a different price.\n- Not all rooms are occupied.\n- All rooms have the same price."}

Then it states there are 83 shelves and they want to put them evenly onto the shelves. It then says they want to know how many more books need to be purchased to put evenly onto the shelves. The keyword 4,305 suggests this problem is likely using multiplication since 4,305 isn't divisible by 83 and 4,305 books cannot be put onto 83 shelves evenly. The keyword 83 is a prime number suggesting it is unlikely this problem has a variable, it is unlikely the book library wants the same number of books on each shelf, and it is unlikely this is an algebra problem. The keyword 51.936 shows the answer is not a whole number which suggests the keyword 4,356 may be an erroneous keyword and the answer may be 52. 4,305 cannot be put onto 83 shelves evenly so 4,356 can either be correct or 52 may be the correct answer.

That means we have 3 things to divide 40 equally amongst, which is 13.33333333. With no more information, we would guess 10, 10, 20. \n\nSince 3 is divisible by 10 and 3.333333333 is not, we can use a few different methods to split the excess up. 1. Make sure there is a multiple of 3 on the horn side, which would mean 5 bags of horns. 2. Make sure there is a multiple of 8 on the candy bar side, which would mean 4 packages of candy bars. \n\nNow, with the 10 left, we could either give the balloons 1 and the horns 2, or the balloons 2 and the horns 1.

How many steps does the giant slide have?", "correct answer": 21.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```Reasoning: Caitlin is at step 13 and walked down 4 steps. The remaining steps to the top is 13-4 = 9. She then walks up 12 steps, so it must be that the slide has 9+12=21 steps. It is known that the number of steps is divisible by 4 (that is, one of the multiple-choice answers is 24, 28 or 32). However, considering that the remaining number is 12, 24 cannot be the answer.

{"question": "London is 11 years old and Blair is 16 years old. Several years ago, Blair was twice as old as London. How old was London then?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\nThe question is about addition/subtraction and multiplication/division problems and their word problem counterparts. The problem is that the keywords are not used for anything. There is no mathematical relationship between \"twice\" and \"two\". We could imagine that the word twice means double. However, \"Blair\" was twice as old as \"London\" means that \"Blair\" was older than \"London\". Therefore, it means \"Blair\" is older than \"London\" (which may be a tautology in the answer statement) and not that \"Blair\" was double the age of \"London\". In fact, the answer 8 does not match with this interpretation, either. So, I would interpret it as a multiplication problem. Let \"L\" be the age of \"London\" at that time and \"B\" be the age of \"Blair\" at that time. The information in the question means that 2L = 16 (i.e. Blair was twice as old as London at that time). Therefore, L = 8 and the answer should be 8. So, I am 95% confident that the above answer is correct.\n"}

The only way we know how many questions Steve answered blank is by subtracting the total questions from the amount of questions Steve answered, so we must subtract 45 questions from 38 questions answered by Steve, which gives us 7 questions blank."}

The only thing I know is that it's divisible by 8, which means the ones digit has to be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, which means the only option we can't eliminate is 40.\nReasoning: The question states \"Eddie is thinking of a number that is divisible by both 8 and 5\". \"Divisible by\" means a factor of. In other words, all the factors of the number must be multiples of 8 and 5. This rules out all the other answers. For example, 12 is a factor of 24, but not of 8, so 24 is not divisible by 8. 24 also is not divisible by 5, since 5 does not evenly divide 24.

How many more coints of the total than quarts does Trevor have?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "4.8", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:\n\nIn this case, I first assume that the reasoner is a student, so the question is to calculate the rest coins of dimes that are not quarters. Trevor counted 77 coins, and he counted 29 quarters. We need to find out how many coins of the rest are dimes. Therefore, the rest of coins are 77 - 29 = 48. There are 48 coins left.\n\nI then assume the possible answer is correct. Trevor counted 29 quarters, and the rest are dimes, so Trevor counted 48 dimes, in this case. There are 29 coins in a dollar, and 48 coins are 48/29 = 1.66 dollars, which is 48 - 29 = 19 cents short of 1.66 dollars. Therefore, the reasoner should subtract 19 from 48 to get 29 as quarters. In this case, the answer should be 29 - 48 = -19. Therefore, the answer is not 4.8.\n\nTherefore, the possible answer is correct with a probability of 50%."}

I am not sure about that, but the answer is fine. \n\n\n# Feedback to the author\n\nYou have some interesting keywords but you should rephrase the keywords a little bit. The keyword should give us the necessary information and not only the keywords. In the keyword '5th student: 53', what should I guess after the 5th student? It could be the sixth or it could be the eleventh student. It could be anything. The keywords are fine, but not detailed enough.\n\n# More feedback\nIn general, it is a good exercise to get used to working with keywords and to know what to do with keywords. So, I want to give you some more keywords, and let you know what to do with these keywords. Please use the same format as you did before (1) to list the"}

This way you help other people to see if they understand the reasoning.\nFor example:\n\n```\nThe question is how many ounces of grape juice were used. By looking at the recipe, we know that 8 ounces of orange juice is required for 3 ounces of grape juice. That is, for every 8 ounces of orange juice used, 3 ounces of grape juice is required. Let's call this as 8 ounces of orange juice = 3 ounces of grape juice.\n\nNicky used 72 ounces of orange juice. Thus, in total, the recipe requires 72/3 = 24 ounces of grape juice. However, the question states that Nicky used 72 ounces of orange juice. Thus, we can know that he didn't use 24 ounces of grape juice. Instead, he used fewer. That is, he used 72 - 24 = 48 ounces of grape juice. So, the answer is 48 ounces.\n```"}

If you use the same reasoning as you do in a word problem, you will likely pick an incorrect answer. The ratio 8:3 means 3 is a part of 8 and they are equivalent. So if Joey's rope is 56 cm long, then Chad's rope will be 56cm / 3 = 18cm long. The keyword `length` implies you should choose a number larger than 18cm, so you pick 24cm as the answer. \nHowever, the problem actually means `The ratio of the length of Joey's rope to Chad's rope is 8:3.`, so 56cm should be 24cm, and 24cm should be 3cm.

How many centimeters long was the board after the carpenter cut it?", "correct answer": 519.0, "llm answer": "438 cm", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nSolution:\n\nAs we can see the 5.28 m long board is a unit length problem. We just need to convert 5.28 m to cm, then 9 cm to the same unit as 5.28 m, and finally subtract 9 cm from 5.28 m. If the unit of a number is not clear, we assume it is in cm. For example, if the board's length is 3.12, it could be 3.12 m or 3.12 cm. We cannot do calculations before we are sure about the unit of the number. \n\nWhen it comes to the given 9 cm, we need to know the unit is cm. To be sure, we can check the question, it does say 'cut 9 cm off the end of the board', which shows the length unit is cm, not m.\n\nTo calculate 5.28 m in cm, we just need to multiply it by 100 (100 cm in 1 m). It becomes 528 cm.\n\nTo calculate 9 cm in m, we just need to divide it by 100 (100 cm in 1 m). It becomes 0.09 m.\n\nAfter doing these calculations, 528 cm -"}

Since Noah's family ate 8600 g of the trail mix, Noah had 12000 - 8600 = 4200 g of trail mix left.\n\nQ: What would you think about the answer 4200 g if you didn't consider 12 kg as 12000 g? And why?\nSince Noah made 12 kg of trail mix, which means there are 12 000 g of trail mix in total. Since Noah's family ate 8600 g of the trail mix, Noah had 12 000 - 8600 = 4200 g of trail mix left"}

They are about the money, so we might want to think about the relationship between money, then about the relationship between numbers, since money is represented by numbers.\n\nNow let's think about the numbers. We know Diane has 27 cents, and the cookies cost 65 cents. So Diane doesn't have enough to buy the cookies. Let's now think about how much money Diane doesn't have, i.e. the difference. We know that when you subtract a smaller number from a larger one, the result is always larger than the smaller one. So the answer has to be a larger number than 27 cents.\n\nIn fact, we could also notice the key words \"difference\" and \"cost\" to give us hints that we are dealing with subtraction problems here, and when we think of subtraction we should think of the smaller number. The smaller number here is 27 cents.\n\nAs the result, the answer is 38 cents.\n\nLet's do a quick calculation to make sure the answer is right.\n\n65 - 27 = 38\n\nCorrect Answer: 38 cents\n\nQ: Which step did you miss?\n```[Step:"}

{"question": "The sum of two consecutive odd numbers is 20. Find the numbers.", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "There are no odd numbers whose sum is 20", "confidence": 0.9777, "probing response": "97.77%\n```Justification: Because odd numbers are not even, they can only add up to an odd number, not a number like 20. If one of the numbers is 1, the other will be 19. If one of them is 3, the other will be 17. If one of them is 5, the other will be 15. So there are no combinations of odd numbers with the sum of 20.```\n\nExplanation:\nFirst, it can be easily noticed that the answer is the simplest form as it is an all-or-nothing answer. That is, either there is a pair of consecutive odd numbers with the sum of 20 or there is none. So it is unlikely to be a wrong answer.\nSecond, when two consecutive odd numbers sum up to 20, their arithmetic mean, or the average, is $\\frac{20}{2}=10$. But 10 is an even number. That means it cannot be represented by an odd number because the sum of two consecutive numbers must be odd. So there is no solution to the problem.\nTherefore, the answer is correct and the probability of it being correct is 100%."}

So the relationship is this: if the number of seashells were given to Tom were bigger, the number of seashells left were smaller. And we have 49 seashells left. So it is safe to assume that `x` (the number of seashells that were given to Tom) should be smaller.\n\nBut how much smaller should it be? We don't have any information in the question to find that out.\n\nSo this is the time to apply our reasoning method `Rule of Subtraction`.\n\nLet's make a table to represent `x` and `(62 - x)`, which represents how many seashells did"}

It is a math problem that requires basic arithmetic skills to solve. In the question, we are given information about the number of large and small ink cartridges in stock and the cost of one cartridge. The answer to the question is the maximum number of ink cartridges that can be purchased with a given amount of money. To solve this problem, we can first write down the information given in the question: Large ink cartridges = 7 in stock Small ink cartridges = 5 in stock Cost of one ink cartridge = 14 dollars We can then list all the possible combinations of ink cartridges that can be purchased with 182 dollars: 14 dollars x 1 ink cartridge = 14 dollars (1 large ink cartridge) 14 dollars x 2 ink cartridges = 28 dollars (2 large ink cartridges) 14 dollars x 3 ink cartridges = 42 dollars (3 large ink cartridges) 14 dollars x 4 ink cartridges = 56 dollars (4 large ink cartridges) 14 dollars x 5 ink cartridges = 70 dollars (5 large ink cartridges) 14 dollars x 6 ink cartridges = 84 dollars (6 large ink cartridges"}

Find the fraction.", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "3/6", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Reasoning\n\nIn this problem, we have three pieces of information: the fraction is 4/5, it becomes 1/2 when 5 is subtracted from both the numerator and denominator, and it becomes 3/6 when 1 is added to both the numerator and denominator. The question asks us to find the fraction, and the possible answer given is 3/6.\n\nTo start with, let's consider the second piece of information, which tells us that if we subtract 5 from both the numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes 1/2. This means that 4 - 5 = 1, and 5 - 5 = 0, which gives us the fraction 1/2. Now, let's consider the first piece of information, which tells us that the original fraction was 4/5. This means that we need to add 1 to both the numerator and denominator to get the fraction 3/6. Since we already have the fraction 1/2, we can simply add 1 to both the numerator and denominator to get the fraction 3/6, which is the correct answer.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the additional information provided in the question, it is clear"}

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so the first angle can be written as `x - 40`.\n- The second angle is double the first, so the second angle can be written as `2(x - 40)`. This can be simplified to `2x - 80`.\n- The sum of all three angles is equal to 180 degrees: `(x - 40) + (2x - 80) + 40 = 180`\n- `3x - 80 = 180` by expanding `(x - 40) + (2x - 80) + 40 = 180`. The `40` at the end can be ignored since the equation only has to hold for one value of `x`.\n- `3x = 260` by adding 80 to both sides of `3x - 80 = 180`.\n- `x = 260 / 3 = 86 2/3` by dividing both sides of `3x = 260` by 3.\n- The angles are `(x - 40), (2x - 80)`, and"}

What did it cost Theo to reseed the lawn?", "correct answer": 9.8, "llm answer": "$(2 - pi)/4", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nReasoning: Since the grass seed covers 50 square feet and 5 feet is the length of the leash, then the leash covers 25 square feet. The 25 square feet covered by the leash forms a sector in a circle with a radius of 5 ft. Since we know the area of this sector to be $25pi/4$ sq. ft. We know that the length of the arc to be $25pi/4 * (5 ft / 25pi) = 1 ft$. Since this is the length of the arc, we can now find the area of the sector since area of sector $= r^2 * theta/2$. Then we find the area of the circle which is $25pi * (5 ft)^2$. Then subtract the area of the sector to find the remaining part of the lawn to reseed. $25pi * (5 ft)^2 - r^2 * theta/2 = (25pi - 5pi) * (5 ft)^2$ which is $20pi$ sq. ft.

If I assume the base and the height of the triangle are the same (and I assume that is reasonable), then the triangle should have half the area of the rectangle. So the answer is 24/2 = 12. However, the question said that the ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle is 2:5. If I divide 24 by 5, then I get 4.8 which is closest to 12. Since I assume this is a close-ended test with no decimal, I'll choose 4.8. However, this solution seems a little contrived. There must be something I'm missing. Maybe there are many different possibilities that the base and height can take. For example, I can take the base and height of the triangle to be 4.8 and 6. This will give the ratio as 2:5.

The diameter of 2m is 1m larger than the radius, so the answer will be about 2^2Pi, or 4Pi, which is not far off from 3.14. However, if the area of the seal was 1m x 2m, this would give an answer of 2m^2, which is more plausible since a larger area will be easier to make.

We want to know how many tickets we would have left if we rode the roller coaster as many times as we could. This means that we will spend as many tickets as we can afford on the ride. We can represent the number of tickets we would have left by the variable x. Now we need to create an equation that represents this scenario. Let's start by writing down the number of tickets we have in total, which is 686. We will also write down the number of tickets we spend on each ride, which is 6. Now we need to find the number of rides we can take. To do this, we can divide the total number of tickets we have by the number of tickets we spend on each ride. This gives us: $$686 \\div 6 = 114.33$$ Since we can't take a fraction of a ride, we will round down to the nearest whole number, which is 114. This means that we can take 114 rides with our 686 tickets. To find the number of tickets we would have left after taking these"}

If he scores only 2 points each round, he would only score 712 total points. This is 713 less than his goal of 1,425. So, 713 = 357.5 rounds.\n\nIn 357.5 rounds, he would score 714.5 total points. He would need to score 1 more point to reach his goal of 1,425 points. So, 357.5 + 1 = 358.5 rounds.\n\nHowever, the problem does not say to \"score exactly two points each round.\" The average is 2 points per round, and the problem says \"scores exactly two points each round.\" Since it is an average, he could score 1,000 points in 500 rounds and still average 2 points per round.\n\nSo, if he scores 1,000 points in 500 rounds, and needs to score 725 points, 725 = 325 rounds.\nSo, Billy"}

The calculation is `163/84`.\nTo round to the nearest whole number, we can use the [ROUND] key on the calculator, or we can use the [ROUND] symbol. The calculation is `163/84 [ROUND]`.\nSince the result of the division (1.9) is not a whole number, we need to round it to the nearest whole number.

Here we need to apply the concept of area of a rectangle, which is \"length times width\".\n\nHence, \"6 square inches\" is the most likely to be correct.\n\n\nQ: How likely is the book to be in the state of Virginia?\nConfidence: 0.99\n\nThis question is difficult for me to answer because it requires a lot of background knowledge and I don't have the time or resources to gather that information.

What is the perimeter of the wood?", "correct answer": 22.0, "llm answer": "22 ft", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nReasoning: I think the words \"piece of plywood\" are important because a piece of wood can be any size and we need to be careful about which side is the width and which side is the length. We need to be careful because we need to make sure that we don't accidentally double count the measurements. For example, if we counted the side that is 5 feet long and then counted the side that is 6 feet long we would get 11 feet when we should only get 10 feet. To avoid this mistake we can use the keyword \"2\" to make sure that we only count the measurements once.\n\nWe know that the length is 6 feet. We know that the width is 5 feet. To calculate the perimeter of a piece of wood we need to add the length and the width together. Since the length is 6 feet and the width is 5 feet, the perimeter of the piece of wood is 6 feet plus 5 feet, which is 11 feet."}

If the ratio of books to bookmarks sold was 9:2,. how many bookmarks did the store sell?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30.0%\n\nQ: Consider the book to bookmark ratio of 9:2. This can be represented as 2/9 or 0.22222... which is equal to approximately 0.22 or 22%. This means that for every 9 books sold, only 2 bookmarks were sold. If we assume that this ratio remains constant throughout the sale period, we can use it to estimate the number of bookmarks sold.\nLet's first calculate the total number of units sold (books and bookmarks combined). We know that the ratio of books to bookmarks is 9:2, which means that for every 11 units sold, 9 units were books and 2 units were bookmarks. Therefore, the total number of units sold is 11 x 72 = 792.\nNext, we can use the ratio to calculate the number of bookmarks sold. We know that for every 9 books sold, 2 bookmarks were sold. Therefore, if we sell 792 books, then we will also sell 2/9 x 792 = 176 bookmarks.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the store sold approximately 176 bookmarks."}

If you add packs, you multiply the price by packs. You go from 3 packs times 1.59 to 6 packs times the same price. That is, 3×1.59=4.77, 6×1.59=9.54, 9.54−4.77=4.77, 9.54−4.77=4.77, and 4.77×2=9.54. The second step is wrong because it assumes that adding 2 packs costs 4.77×2=9.54, but adding packs actually doubles the cost. Thus, it is wrong. Thus, the possible answer is wrong because it is based on wrong reasoning. It is, however, not impossible that I have overlooked a reasoning that justifies the answer. It is also possible that the problem has been created by asking how much you pay if you double the number of packs instead of how much you pay if you double the number of packs. The second interpretation would be wrong because the number of packs in a pack is doubled. In other words, if you buy 6 packs, you are buying"}

So we need to find out how many action figures in total can be held by these shelves. Here's the reasoning.\n\nLet's say Adam can hold 9 action figures in one shelf. Now, each shelf has 9 action figures. There are three shelves. So, Adam can hold three shelves of 9 action figures.\n\nIn order to find how many action figures in total can be held by Adam's shelves, we need to find out how many times we can multiply 9.

If the band instructor put the students into rows with 5 students in each row,. how many rows could he make?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: \nReasoning to the confidence value: \n1. As 40 is divisible by 5, it is easy to imagine the band instructor putting the students into rows with 5 students in each row and there are 8 such rows. However, if the question is written in the form of \"how many rows are there\", then the instructor would never be confused about that. The main thing here is about the students to be in rows with 5 students in each row. \n\n2. As there are multiple ways of putting 40 students into rows with 5 students in each row, the keyword \"If\" could be misread as \"the most likely to happen\" instead of \"a way\". Hence the most likely to happen way is what students usually think about the most. \n\n3. We could not have \"10 rows with 4 students in each row\" because 40 is not divisible by 4. \n\n4. We could have \"10 rows with 4 students in each row\" if the question is written as \"how many rows could he make with 10 students in each row\". \n\n5. We could have \"9 rows with 5 students in each row\" if the question is written as \"how many rows"}

How many times did he mow in the spring?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n```Explanation: The words \"during\" and \"times\" imply that Roger mowed his lawn for a duration of 15 times. The words \"9 times\" means that he did not mow his lawn 9 times. 9 does not equal 15, but 15 minus 9 equals 6. 6 is the only answer which makes sense if the lawn was mowed for a total of 15 times. Therefore, 75% is the confidence that Roger mowed his lawn 6 times. ```\n"}

There are 2 grape popsicles. Cherry popsicles and banana popsicles are not mentioned as \"other\" popsicles. Thus, the number of popsicles that are not cherry popsicles and banana popsicles are 15 popsicles. The answer, 3, is not in the choices and also is not a number that can be obtained by subtracting.

Cherry popsicles and banana popsicles are different types of popsicles. If \"banana popsicles\" is the keyword, then the number of popsicles that are not cherry popsicles or banana popsicles is the number of popsicles minus the number of cherry popsicles and banana popsicles, which is 15.

{"question": "On Monday Debby jogged 2 kilometers. On Tuesday she jogged 5 kilometers and on Wednesday she jogged 9. How many kilometers did she jog total?", "correct answer": 16.0, "llm answer": "16 km", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n```Reasoning: On the one hand, 16 km seems to be too large because we only see the change from 2 to 5 to 9 km. On the other hand, the question uses a very formal and mathematical vocabulary such as \"kilo meter\". The keywords 2 km, 5 km and 9 km might be very concrete, and there are not so many possible numbers of kilometers. Moreover, we could assume that the number of kilometers Debby jogged is always increasing, which means that Debby might have jogged at least 5 kilometers on Monday. We could also guess that the keywords of the question might include the word \"total\" in order to not only have the sum of 2 km, 5 km and 9 km but to also include the initial value. In my opinion, this question is similar to the [example question](https://github.com/alexa-matsubara/ReasoningQuestions) in which we have to reason about the difference between 1000 m and 100 km. The question is quite difficult but not impossible to solve. ```\n\nQ: Why do you think Debby jogged 16 km total on Wednesday?\nReasoning: From the keywords in the question,"}

How many dogs does the pet store have now?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\nReasoning:\nThe most common reason people may choose the wrong answer could be that they misread the question. As a result, they may think it is asking for the total number of dogs the pet store will have. That is not what the question is asking for. The correct question is asking for the current number of dogs the pet store has. There is a difference between the current number of dogs and the total number of dogs that the pet store will have. Another common reason for choosing the wrong answer could be that people may not have done the operation correctly. As a result, people may forget to add or add the numbers in the wrong order. People may also not know how to solve the problem correctly. For example, people may think that they need to add the 5 and 3 first and then add the 2 to the result. The correct way to solve this problem is to add the 5 and 3 together and then add the result to the 2.\n\n"}

If there is no remainder,. what is the largest possible number of sweets in each tray?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "20", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n```Explanation: If there is no remainder, the number of sweets in each tray must be a factor of the number of sweets in the entire bag. 20 is the greatest common divisor of 36 and 44.

What is the greatest number of sandwiches they can make if each sandwich has the same filling?", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "72", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: \nWhen reasoning for the given possible answer 72, we have:\n1. Since the question asks for the greatest number of sandwiches we can make if each sandwich has the same filling, and the keyword says the sandwiches have the same filling, we need to find the greatest number of sandwiches we can make.\n2. Since we are finding the greatest number of sandwiches, we can look at each of the options for sandwiches (one with only turkey filling, one with only cheese filling, and one with only tomato filling) and find the greatest value of those options.\n3. The option with only turkey filling is the greatest, so we can look at the given information and figure out how many sandwiches we can make using only turkey filling.\n4. The given information says that we have 72 turkey slices. To find the greatest number of sandwiches we can make with only turkey filling, we need to divide the number of turkey slices by the number of slices we need for each sandwich. Since the question doesn't say anything about how many slices we need for each sandwich, we can assume that each sandwich needs one slice of turkey. So, we can divide 72 by 1 to find that we can make 72 sandwiches using only turkey filling.\nTherefore, since"}
{"question": "Two bicycle enthusiasts are leaving Cincinnati at the same time. One is biking 840 miles to Boston. The other is biking 440 miles to Atlanta. What is the greatest number of miles a day each can bike if they want to cover equal distances each day?", "correct answer": 40.0, "llm answer": "440", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70.00%\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nLet the first cyclist ride at $v_1$ miles per day, and the second cyclist ride at $v_2$ miles per day. The first cyclist will arrive in Boston after $840/v_1$ days, and the second cyclist will arrive in Atlanta after $440/v_2$ days. For the problem to be solvable, the two cyclists must reach their destinations at the same time, which means that the first cyclist needs to reach Boston after the same number of days that the second cyclist needs to reach Atlanta. This means the following equation must be satisfied:\n\n$$840/v_1 = 440/v_2$$\n\nWe can cancel out both sides by $v_1$, so we get:\n\n$$840/v_1 = 440/v_1 v_2$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$v_2 = 840/440$$\n\nSince the second cyclist travels 840 miles over 440 days, the second cyclist travels 1.9 miles per day on average. Thus the second cyclist travels at an average speed of 1.9 miles per day. For the two cyclists to arrive at their destinations at the same time, the first cyclist must also travel at the same speed.

For his birthday he got eighteen more. How many cards does Mike have total? [64 + 18 = 82]```\n* If you see `+` then you can consider it as addition. But in the problem, `Mike owned sixty-four baseball cards. For his birthday he got eighteen more`, you don't know it means 18 added to the 64? Because Mike can lose the baseball cards or buy more baseball cards. So it's not safe to assume the `+` means addition. \n---\n"}

How many minutes total did she spend drawing?", "correct answer": 41.0, "llm answer": "41", "confidence": 0.0005, "probing response": "0.05%\n\nExplanation: Bianca spent a total of 22 minutes drawing at school and a total of 19 minutes drawing at home. Since she spent the same amount of time drawing at school as she did at home, the total time spent drawing is 22 + 19 = 41 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 41.\n\nIt is possible for Bianca to have spent more or less time drawing at each location, resulting in a different total time spent drawing. However, given the limited information provided in the question, 41 minutes is the most likely answer.\n\nThe keyword \"drawing\" can be used to narrow down the possible answers to those related to drawing, such as \"art,\" \"painting,\" or \"sketching.\" This can help to eliminate any answers that are unrelated to the topic of the question.\n\nOverall, the confidence level in this answer is low due to the limited information provided in the question and the multiple ways to arrive at the correct answer. A more confident answer would require additional information or a more specific question.\n\nA good practice would be to always include a justification or explanation for your reasoning when answering a question.

First the number of pieces of candy Isabel has are calculated. Sixteen pieces from neighbors + five pieces from sister = 21 pieces of candy. Now divide 21 pieces of candy by three pieces of candy Isabel eats per day = 7. Thus, the candy would last seven days. Possible answer 3 days has an answer which is 7-3 = 4 off. This is considered too much error, so I concluded the answer is not correct. 4/21 is about 19%. However, the answer with 7 days is incorrect as well, since Isabel received 21 pieces of candy. That makes the answer not correct, too. 20/21 is about 95%. The question is asking for Isabel's candy to last her. She is receiving candy from the neighbors and sister. When 16 pieces from the neighbors + five pieces from sister, 21 pieces of candy are being received. If Isabel eats 3 pieces of candy per day, how long would her candy last her?

At the end, I found the following equation\n```\n14*4*4*4*4*4*4/5*5*5*5*5*5*5=36\n```\nTherefore, I believed the possible answer to be correct with confidence 100%. However, looking back at the question again, I found that the possible answer could be wrong if the building had already installed more than 5 windows. For example, if the building had already installed 6 windows before the builder starts the job, there would be 8 windows left to be installed. It would take the builder 2 hours to install 1 window. Therefore, it would take the builder 16 hours to install the 8 windows. In this case, the possible answer would be incorrect.\n\nBased on my reasoning and the discussion, I concluded that the possible answer is correct with 0% confidence.\n"}

Thus, 5 figures should be multiplied by 2, which is 10. Then 10 is multiplied by the price of each figure, which is $5. In other words, 10 * $5 = $50. Additionally, the total cost for the figures has been stated, which is  $60. Thus, the answer is correct, as 50 + 10 = 60.\n\nExplanation: In the first part of the question, the total cost for 5 figures is $50. The keywords were introduced in the second part of the question.

To calculate the amount of money earned, one would need to know the prices of the meals and drinks, the amounts of tips given by the 5 customers who did not leave a tip, and the number of customers who did not leave a tip. Since none of this information is provided in the question, it is impossible to say how much money the waiter earned.\n\nThe question is asking for the amount of money the waiter earned, which is 5 times the amount of money earned by each of the customers who left a tip. The question gives us the amount of money earned by each of the 5 customers who left a tip, which is 3 dollars. Therefore, the amount of money earned by all 5 customers is 15 dollars. Since we are looking for the amount of money the waiter earned, we need to multiply 15 by 5, which is 75 dollars. Therefore, the correct answer is 75 dollars."}

So he gave to his 18 friends x/18. Then he ate the rest. This means that he ate 45 - x/18.\nLet y = x/18. Then Sean ate 45 - y.\nSince y is x/18, then y = 45/18.\nThe problem states that each person received an equal number of Starbursts, and then Sean ate what was left. This means that he ate the remaining Starbursts, 45 - y.\nSean ate 45 - y, which is 45 - 45/18. This means he ate 2.5 Starbursts.
