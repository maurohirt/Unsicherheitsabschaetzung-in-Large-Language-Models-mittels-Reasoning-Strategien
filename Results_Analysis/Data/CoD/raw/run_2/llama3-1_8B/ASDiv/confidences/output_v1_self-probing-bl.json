From that, it can be inferred that the first set of plums is 17 plums.\nThe next statement is 'More plums were added to the basket'. This is an open statement and can be taken to mean a set of plums that is greater than 17 plums. However, for clarity, one can think of this as 18 plums. We can now infer that the first set of plums is 17 plums, and the second set of plums is 18 plums.\nThe next statement is 'Now there are 21 plums'. From this, it can be inferred that the second set of plums is 21 plums. This is because there are a total of 21 plums after the second set of plums has been added. Since the first set of plums was 17, the second set must be 21.\nTherefore, the number of plums added to the basket is 21 - 17 = 4.\nThe confidence is 100% because the reasoning is sound and clear"}

How many gold stars did Shelby earn in all?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n\n\n## Solution\n\n**Show reasoning:**  **The correct answer is 7.** The expression \"4 gold stars\" tells me I need to add 4 to some number to get the total number of stars Shelby earned. Since the expression \"3 more\" tells me to add 3 to that some number. That some number must be 4 or it would not work. Since the expression \"3 more\" would not work if the some number were 3 or it would result in 6 total stars. Therefore, I must add 3 to 4 to get the total number of stars, which gives 7 total stars.\n\n**Answer:** **50%**. Although Shelby could have earned more than 7 gold stars, she could have earned fewer than 7, so it is not very likely that the correct answer is 7.\n\n"}

So we should find the 23rd permutation of the following array: [6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. 6 is at index 0 and 0 has to come first. 1 is at index 1 and 6 has to come next. We have 24 shirts, but we can't use 24, because Gavin only has 23 shirts, so 23 has to come last. Therefore 23 should be put at the last position. \n\nNow the problem is reduced to the following: What is the 23rd permutation of the following array: [6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]?\n\nThere are 6 blue shirts.

In other words, they chose the best builders they could find to work on this project. This implies that there must be a large number of workers involved in this task, so it is reasonable to assume that the total number of workers is greater than 500. The answer choice \"862\" is the only option that is greater than 500, so it is the most likely correct answer.

Please include the step by step reasoning for the answer, e.g., if you think it is 1/2, you may simply write \"1/2\" for \"confidence\" and then explain, \"it is 1/2 because there are 2 ways to choose the answer and each of them is equally likely.\" ]```\n\nExplanation: The first step in solving this problem is to determine the correct discount price for the plants. To do this, we must first convert the dollar amount to a percentage. 467.00 ÷ 399.00 = 1.1685. To get the correct percentage, we must multiply this number by 100. 1.1685 x 100 = 116.85. This means that the correct discount price is 116.85%. Next, we must determine how much money was actually spent on the plants. To do this, we must subtract the discount from the original price. 467.00 – 116.85 = 350.15. Therefore, the answer is 68.00."}

Subtracting a smaller number from a bigger number is the same as adding the smaller number to the smaller number. We know 70 - 36 = 34, and that 34 + 36 = 70. I then realized that this is the same thing as \"how much more paint do we need\". So 34 gallons is the answer. The question is asking \"how much more paint will he need\". We don't know how much he originally had (maybe he just bought the 23 gallons, and he only has 23 gallons of paint at this moment. In that case, you would need 47 more gallons of paint), but we can assume that he is only finishing off his current paint and doesn't want to waste any of it.\n```"}

We know that each bus has 3 adult supervisors to guide the kids, so we know that there are 3 adult supervisors per bus. To figure out the total number of adult supervisors, we need to multiply 3 by the number of buses.\nTo figure out the number of buses, we first need to figure out how many kids are going to the bird zoo. We know that there are 7 buses going to the bird zoo, so we know that 7 buses is the number of buses. So we need to multiply 7 by 3 to figure out the total number of adult supervisors.\nTo figure out the number of adult supervisors, we multiply the number of buses (7) by the number of adult supervisors per bus (3).\nSo we can do 7 x 3 = 21.

There are 7 ways of choosing one feather (7 colors), 6 ways of choosing another feather (6 remaining colors), 5 ways for the 3rd feather, and so on, so there are 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040 possible cases, hence the final answer is 7x5040 = 35,280.\nNote that there might be some better ways of counting that we did not know about.

Here's a quick explanation:\n\nLet p = 24 - n, the number of potatoes Jane has left over after her mom serves each of them n potatoes. 3p = 24 means 3p + p = 24 + p. 4p = 24 + p. p = 24 / 4 = 6. Thus n = 24 - p = 24 - 6 = 18. Now, since there are 3 people, each has n / 3 = 6 potatoes.\n\nThis is not a very satisfying answer, however, because it assumes that Jane has an equal number of potatoes as her mom and dad. That is not necessarily true. The answer assumes that each person receives an equal number of potatoes, even though Jane has less than 24. In other words, it assumes that Jane received an equal number of potatoes, but that's not necessarily the case. That's why the question is so difficult.\n\nIf you want a more satisfying answer, you can solve for n without using the word \"equal.\" Since 3n = 24, n = 24 / 3 = 8."}

For example,\n4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24\nThe value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.\nThe factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic use counts the possible distinct sequences and arrangements of objects. It also appears in formulations of other mathematical concepts like the Gamma function and Binomial theorem. Some specific applications are in calculating the likelihood of sequences of random events and in probability theory in calculating the variance of a population.\n\nFactorial can be thought of as the number of ways in which n items can be permuted or rearranged. For example, using the letters A, B, C the 3 objects or items can be arranged in six ways:\nABC\nACB\nBAC\nBCA\nCAB\nCBA\nA factorial can also be defined by the following expression:\nn! = n \\times (n-"}

However, there is a slight chance that it might not be the best answer. There is a slight chance that the answer may have been mistyped or there may have been a typo in the question. For example, the question may have been \"How many markers does Megan have altogether if Robert gave her 109 more markers?\"\nIn that case, the answer would be 326 + 109 = 435.

{"question": "A regular octagon whose sides measure 3 ft each. Find the perimeter.", "correct answer": 24.0, "llm answer": "24 ft", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation:\n\nSince the octagon is regular, the angles are all the same, which is 135 degrees.  So, the triangles in the figure below are isosceles, with a base angle of 45 degrees, and with a height of 3.\n\nIn triangle $PAB$, we have $tan(45) = \\dfrac{3}{x}$, so that $x = 3$. The other side is 3 also, so the perimeter is 12.\n\nSince the angles are all equal, we can just multiply the perimeter by 8 to get the perimeter of the octagon, so 96. However, this is not one of the possible answers, so there is no need to go into further detail.\n\nBy the symmetry of the octagon, the midpoint of side $AB$ is also the midpoint of side $DE$, so we have triangles $ABE$ and $EDC$ congruent, so that the height of triangle $ABE$ is the same as the height of triangle $EDC$ is the same as the height of the original triangle, which is 3. Thus, $tan(45) = \\dfrac{3}{x}$, so that $x = 3"}

{"question": "Mrs. Hilt needs to share $3.75 equally among three total people. How much money will each person get?", "correct answer": 1.2, "llm answer": "$1.25", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n\nA: In our problem, we want to share $3.75 among three people. The most straightforward method is to share equally and each person gets $3.75 / 3 = $1.25. We need to justify our answer. However, in many situations, it is not possible to share equally. For example, a teacher needs to grade three papers, but it takes longer to grade the second paper than the first and third one. As such, the paper may take 1 hour, 2 hours and 1 hour, respectively. In this case, a teacher may decide to spend 1/3 hour on each paper and grades equally. \n\nIt is also possible to share unequally due to the need of different amounts for different people. For example, if a group of students decided to spend money on dinner with friends. One student has a big appetite, and another student has a small appetite. In this case, one may decide to spend more money on the dinner with friends to accommodate the large appetite. \n\nIn the above examples, the sharing of money is either equal or unequal. In reality, it may be difficult to determine if a sharing of money is equal or unequal. For example, there is no standard on how"}

Since each pizza has 6 slices, and there are 5 pizzas left, she would have 30 slices left. Since each slice is a different pizza, we cannot take 30 slices, and say she has 5.5 pizzas.

The number of black candy boxes left are 3-# of black candy boxes bought = 3-B. The number of white candy boxes left are 3-# of white candy boxes bought = 3-W. The number of blue candy boxes left are 2-# of blue candy boxes bought = 2-B.\n\nThe number of candy boxes left is 2+B+W+2-B = 3+W. We know that B+3=B and W+3=W, hence, W=3.\n\nThus, there are 3 candy boxes left. Hence, the answer to the question is \"3 boxes left\" and the answer to the question is \"3 boxes left\"."}

I can then say that there is a 100% probability that 18 cm is the correct answer because 0.87 - 0.18 = 0.69 and that 0.69 = 69 cm. Since 69 cm = 24 cm + 45 cm, then 18 cm is the correct answer with 100% probability```\n```What if you think that the answer 18 cm is incorrect, which is the answer that I actually chose?

So we assume it's possible that it's not empty and there are already emails waiting. In this case, there are 2 emails in the inbox in the morning. Hence we count 10 emails in total.\n\nHowever, the question does not explicitly state that Jack's inbox is empty in the afternoon. So we assume it's possible that the inbox is not empty and that Jack received 8 emails in the morning but it is empty in the afternoon. In this case, there are 2 emails in total.\n\nSo the most probable answer is either 2 or 10. Hence the confidence is 40%.\n\n"}

How many coins does Savant save together?", "correct answer": 76.0, "llm answer": "76", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\nExplanation: Savant has 3 jars. He puts in 34 coins in the first jar, 29 coins in the second jar and 13 coins in the third jar. How many coins does Savant save together?\nThis is a word problem. We can solve it with simple algebra. If we take all coins to be 'c', then Savant puts in 34 coins in the first jar. That means 'c-34' coins are left. 29 coins are put into the second jar. So that means 'c-34-29' coins are left. Finally, 13 coins are put into the third jar. This leaves 'c-34-29-13' coins left. These are the saved coins. In this case, this number is the same as 'c'. So we can write:\n```\nc = c - 34 - 29 - 13\nc = c - 76\nc - 76 = 0\nc = 76\n```\nTherefore Savant saves 76 coins.\nIt is not easy to solve this question with just words or just numbers. Solving it requires a combination of numbers and words. A person who can do this combination easily is a 'Savant'."}

What is the probability that each student selects a different book?\nPossible Answer: 10/1680\n\nExplanation:\nFor a student to select a different book, only one of the remaining books should not be selected. Thus, the first student can have 6 different books, the second student 5 different books, and the third student 4 different books. The fourth student has no choice.\nThe probability of a different book can be calculated by 6! / (1! 5!) * 5! / (2! 3!) * 4! / (3! 1!) * 3! / (4!"}

Since 7 is divisible by 3, the answer is $\\frac{90}{7}=12+\\frac{6}{7}$. Since $\\frac{6}{7}<1$, we do not need to round up. Hence, 12 large groups can be formed.

I can only think of 2 reasons:\n1. There are 250 vitamins, so after Gil takes 12 per day, he will only have 238 left. So the answer is 12-238=226\n2. Gil takes 12 per day, so in total he will have taken 250*12=3000 vitamins. If the bottle had 250 vitamins, there will be 250-3000=2750 vitamins left, so the answer is 12-2750=2748\nBoth reasoning above seems unreasonable. I would not bet on answer 2 to be correct.

Do not submit this question as a blank answer.\nExplanation: The problem states that 14 offices should get the same number of bureaus, so you divide 88 by 14 to get 6, which is the number of bureaus that each office should have. The next step is to find out how many bureaus are left over if each office has 6 bureaus. To do this, subtract 6 from 88 to get 82. This means that there are 82 bureaus left over. The next step is to find out how many offices can be created with 82 bureaus. To do this, divide 82 by 6 to get 13. This means that there can be 13 more offices created. Therefore, the correct answer is 13.\n\nExplanation: The problem can be restated as: if 14 bureaus are needed and each office should have 6 bureaus, how many more bure"}

If they start cutting three trees at the same time at 7:48,. at what time will they start cutting trees at the same time again?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "8:36 (and every 48 min.)", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nSolution: For this problem, we need to know three things: the time it takes each worker to complete a task, the number of workers, and the number of tasks to be completed. With these three inputs, we can use the formula T = 1 / (R1 + R2 + … + Rn), where T is the time it takes all workers to complete all tasks, and Ri is the rate of completion for each worker. \n\nHere, the rate of completion for Worker X is 1/16 (one task every 16 minutes), for Worker Y is 1/32, and for Worker C is 1/24. So our equation becomes: T = 1 / (1/16 + 1/32 + 1/24). Simplifying this gives us T = 16/48 = 2/6 = 0.333... hour, which is approximately 20 minutes. So the workers will start cutting trees together again at 7:48 + 20 minutes = 8:08.\n\nThe answer is therefore 8:08.\n\nHowever, there is one important thing to note about this solution - it assumes that each worker continues to work independently of the others until they are all done with their"}

First of all, you can use dimensional analysis: since the masses are given in grams, you can just divide them and you get 0.75 or 75%. Second, you can say that the ratio of the masses is the ratio of their atomic weights. So, the mass of nickel is 240 grams and the mass of copper is 320 grams, so the ratio of the masses is 3:4.

How many songs does Billy still need to learn?", "correct answer": 28.0, "llm answer": "46", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nSolution\nThe problem tells us that Billy has 52 songs in his music book. He knows the names of 18 different guitar chords and he can play 24 songs in his music book. That means, of the 52 songs in his book, 24 songs he has played and he knows 18 different guitar chords. Therefore, 18 of the 24 songs he has played have chords he knows. The rest of the songs he has played, 24 - 18 = 6 of them, he has to learn new chords. There are 52 - 24 = 28 songs in his music book that he has not played. There are 52 - 24 = 28 songs in his music book that he has not played. In order to be able to play all the songs in his music book, he has to learn all the chords. Therefore, out of the 28 songs that he has not played, he needs to learn the chords of all the songs that he has not played, and so, 28 - 6 = 22 songs. \n\nTo calculate the probability that the answer of 46 is correct, we need to see how many ways we can choose the 24 songs he has already played from the "}

Set up the first row as \"Passenger Numbers\" and \"Number who stayed on the bus\"\n2. 46 people got on the bus\n3. 19 people got off at the first stop, so there are now 46 - 19 people on the bus\n4. 15 more people got off at the second stop, so there are 46 - 19 - 15 people left on the bus\n5. 46 - 19 - 15 = 12 passengers are left on the bus at the second stop.\n\nIn this scenario, the number of passengers who got off the bus is equal to the number of passengers who got on the bus. If we say x is the number of passengers who got off the bus, then we can say x = 46 passengers.\nWe can also represent the number of passengers who were left on the bus using the variable y. So, we can say that the passengers who were left on the bus was equal to the number of passengers who got on the bus minus the number of passengers who got off the bus. That is, y = 46 - x.\nWe know that the number of passengers"}

Since they both sold 54 boxes, \nthen we have the equation\n54 = x + (x+17)\nSolve for x, we get x=37.\nThus, Jennifer sold 37+17=54 boxes.\nSo the answer is 54, which is correct.\n```Note: you do not have to justify every word of the explanation, the important thing is to explain in detail the logic and approach. ```"}

The first thing we know is that there are 2 scenarios: Either Corey finds 48 golf balls, or he doesn’t. There are only these 2 possibilities.\nThus, the probability of him finding all the 48 balls is either 1 or 0.\n\nNow, we have 48 – 16 – 18 = 14 balls that are missing. In the above case, the probability of 14 golf balls is simply 0 (he doesn’t find 48 golf balls at all), because the remaining 14 golf balls can’t be found. However, this is just one scenario. We also have other possible scenario that Corey may find some golf balls and he ends up reaching the goal.\n\nLet’s do some guess work. Assume he finds one more ball on each day, that’s 2 balls found, he’ll find 24 balls in total. Thus, he has 48 – 24 – 16 = 8 remaining balls. Therefore, the probability of Corey reaching his goal is 8/14, as we have seen 8 balls still remain ("}

In math we use variables. Let’s assign Peter the variable of P, and Greg the variable of G.\nWe are told that Peter (P) does 24 sit-ups, and Greg (G) does 4 sit-ups for every 3 sit-ups that Peter (P) does. We can write this down as the following equation:\nG = 4P\nIf P = 24 then G = 4P\n4P = 4(24)\n4P = 96\nG = 96\nSo the correct answer is 96. But we were never told who did more sit-ups.

That means there are two possibilities, and we can’t give an exact answer.\nIf Peter did more sit-ups than Greg, then the answer is 96.\nIf Greg did more sit-ups than Peter, then the answer is 96 too.\nSo we have to give two different answers to this question, both of which are 96.\n\nExplanation:\nThis question is in the form of “if this, then how much”.

Similarly, if the number of roses is the same from both the vendors, and Rachel's vendor sells them in groups of 19, then the number of roses must be a multiple of 19. So, the number of roses must be a multiple of both 9 and 19. Since 19 is a prime number, then the number of roses must be a multiple of 9 only.\n\nThe least number of roses that are a multiple of 9 and also a multiple of 19 is 171 (or 171 - 180). This is the least number of roses the customer will have to buy from each vendor."}

If each of the five friends received a different number of candies, would the answer be different? Also, the answer is the remainder. So if we have a formula for finding the number of pieces that will be left over when we divide George's candies, then we can easily find the number of candies he would have left over. What do you think?\n\nI have found a general formula for finding the number of pieces left over: let x be the number of pieces George has, y be the number of friends, and z be the number of pieces each friend will receive. The formula is $x-\\lfloor\\dfrac{x}{z} \\rfloor z$, where $\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor$ is the floor function (which gives you the greatest integer that is smaller than or equal to its argument).

The question asks for a piece of candy. It does not say a piece of candy in one bag or a piece of candy in Amy's possession.\n2. \"Six pieces and had five left\" can be interpreted as 5 pieces were given and 6 were left, or that Amy had 6 pieces and gave 5 and left 1.\n3. It would be better if the question asked for the difference between pieces of candy Amy gave and had left, but even then it can be interpreted in two ways: pieces of candy given minus pieces left, or pieces given plus pieces left.\n\nA:\n1. That was my initial interpretation and it is the correct one.\n2. This is a valid interpretation.\n3. The second interpretation is not reasonable because of the phrase \"left\" after \"Amy had five left\" makes the sentence ambiguous, but implies that \"left\" is a piece that Amy had before giving the candies.\n"}

So the probability is 1/10. Second case is when the first digit is 7 and the second digit could be any number from 0 to 9. So the probability is 1/10. Therefore the probability is 1/10+1/10=2/10=1/5. We got 1/5 because we are looking for the two digit number, it could be 8+7=87 or 7+8=78. 1/5 is the probability of answer 87 to be correct. I hope this explanation is clear and helpful.\n"}

You may use either English or mathematical symbols to explain the steps you have taken to get to your answer.\n\nDan had 18 games played and two of them were played in the evening. The team had won the majority of the games (the most), but were defeated in three games. It was possible to have 10 wins or 15 wins, but if I used the formula for percentage it will be easier to see which one is the best answer.

So that means there are 2.5 baseball cards left. But the answer choices only goes from 1-3, so I think it might be a trick question. So what I did is try to think of the problem in another way. Let's say there are $N$ baseball cards that Fred had and $0.5N$ baseball cards were eaten by the dog. So there are $0.5N$ baseball cards left. But since it's a multiple choice question, we have to pick one. So we'll just try $1$. So there are $0.5$ baseball cards left and it's an integer. That means it can't be $1$, because if it's $1$ then $0.5N = 1$, which means $N = 2$. So we know the answer is not $1$. So let's try the next choice which is $2$. If we choose $2$ then we get $0.5N = 2$ and $N = 4$. This is not an integer,"}

Then the following equations are set up:\n\nx + 2 = 5(y + 2)\nx + 2 = 5y + 10\n\nThen subtract 2 from both sides:\n\nx = 5y + 8\nThen divide both sides by 5:\n\nx/5 = y + 8/5\n\nThis is y plus 8/5 = y + y plus 8/5\n\nThis is just:\n\nx/5 = y + 8/5\n\nTherefore x/5 = y plus 8/5\n\nThen subtract 8/5 from both sides:\n\nx/5 - 8/5 = y\n\nNow multiply both sides by 5:\n\nx - 8 = 5y\n\nThen add 8 to both sides:\n\nx = 5y + 8\n\nFather's current age is 28 and son's current age is 4\n```\nAnswer: I think 98% is reasonable, but I"}

This means that the circumference is equal to 31.4 centimeters. Since the circumference is the distance around the outside of a circle, we can use this information to find the diameter of the lens. To do this, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is: circumference = 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Since the circumference is equal to 31.4 centimeters, we can set up an equation to solve for the radius. 31.4 = 2πr Dividing both sides by 2π, we get: 15.7 = r The radius is therefore 15.7 centimeters. Now that we have the radius, we can use it to find the diameter, which is simply twice the radius. The diameter is therefore 31.4 centimeters, which matches the given answer. Therefore, the above answer is correct and the probability that it is correct is 100%."}

Since the number of pieces in each bag has to be the same, the division of 650 by 3 should result in an integer. However, since 650/3 is not an integer, Billy needs to add more pieces to make it divisible by 3. To find out how many more pieces he needs, we need to find the remainder of 650/3. 650/3 = 216 R 2. Therefore, Billy needs 2 more pieces to make sure each bag has the same amount. 2 pieces * 3 bags = 6 pieces in total.

Second, when we use the formula, it's like we're taking every plate that we own and multiplying by a number that's going to represent the boxes. For example, if we have 1000 plates and we're multiplying by 5, then we will have 5 boxes full of plates. We're taking the number 5 and then multiplying it by the number of plates that we have. To solve this, we use division and then we multiply the answer by the number 5. This is because we need to know the number of boxes that we need and we can't just multiply it by 5. We need to find out the number of boxes that we need to buy.```\n\nQ: Show your full solution and reasoning concisely.\n```The first thing I did was divide 387 by 5 and I got 77.4, which is rounded up to 78.

How many full stacks could they make?", "correct answer": 133.0, "llm answer": "828", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\n\n## Answer\n1. The following problem is inspired by [Project Euler #70](https://projecteuler.net/problem=70). Here we count the number of times that a digit is used in a full stack.  \nThe only number divisible by 6 between 0-100 is 6. Thus, we just need to count all the 9's, 8's, 7's, 6's, 5's, and 4's that are less than 100.  \nTo get the count of the 9's, 8's, 7's, 6's, 5's, and 4's between 0 and 1000, we can do\n```python\nfrom itertools import count\nsum(n == d for n in count(1, 6) for d in range(1, 1001))\n```\nThe result is 827. Thus the answer is 827 stacks of cartons.\n\n\n## Confident: 30%\n"}

Here's why:\n\nTo figure out how many tables they need, we can use a little bit of math. We know that there are 234 people attending the luncheon. Each table can hold 9 people.

If you are willing to accept 40% chance of being wrong, then the answer above is the best.\n```Hint: A good reasoning process is one where if you apply it again, the chance of it being correct is high.

How tall is it?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "3.25 feet", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation:\nThe ratio of width to height is 3 to 7. So, for every 7 feet, we get 3 feet of width. Since we know that the width is 3 feet, we can see that the height would be 7 times the width: 7*3=21. Since this is not equal to the height we need (21 square feet), we can conclude that the correct answer would be more than 3.25 feet. We can further see that the width and the height are factors of 21. So, we can conclude that the height would be greater than 3 feet and less than 7 feet. So, the answer is more likely to be 3.5 or 3.75 or 4 feet.\n"}

If there were 20 bars of white chocolate sold,. how many bars of dark chocolate were sold?", "correct answer": 15.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n\nExplanation: This is a question about proportional reasoning. The first sentence of the question gives the ratio of white chocolate to dark chocolate as 4:3. There were 20 bars of white chocolate sold. In order for the ratio of white chocolate to dark chocolate to be 4:3, there must have been 30 bars of dark chocolate. The number of bars of dark chocolate was 30 - 20 = 10 more than the number of bars of white chocolate. Thus, the number of bars of dark chocolate sold must be 10 more than 20, which is 30."}
{"question": "Kaleb deleted 20 songs from his MP3 player.

If the ratio of the songs he kept to all the songs is 1:3, it means that the total songs is 3x (where x is the songs he kept) or the number of songs he kept times 3, which is 3x. We know that there is 20 songs deleted, and 20 is the number of songs deleted times 10:3, which means 10:3 is the ratio of the number of songs he kept to all the songs. And 20 is 3 times 20/3.

Then it says \"group of 4 friends\", which means they were friends, so the group can be thought of as a single entity. Then the question says \"later 3 more friends came over\", which means the 3 more friends were not part of the original group of 4 friends, but they were now added to the group. So, the total number of people in the group after the 3 more friends came over is 4 + 3 = 7.```"}

How many towels did she buy?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "27", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: Each pack has 3 towels and she bought 9 packs.\n\nThis is the first example of the probability theory. This is a basic question and the answer is obvious. But let's first understand the theory.\nProbability is the quantification of uncertainty of events. It is the number that denotes how likely the event is. A value of 1 means the event is certain to happen. A value of 0 means the event is impossible to happen. \n\nThis question is about two independent events and hence we can just multiply the probability of each event happening.\nFirst, find the probability of each event.\nThere are 3 towels in each pack. And she bought 9 packs of towels. The probability of her buying a particular pack is 9/9=1. Hence, she will have all the towels for sure, no uncertainty about it. Now, there is no need to find the probability of each towel. But let's just find the probability of her getting a particular towel. The probability is 3/9 or 1/3. So we have two independent events with probabilities 1 and 1/3.\nNow, multiply the probabilities of the two independent events to get the probability of the combination of the two independent events.\nSo"}

How many customers left?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: I thought it was 9, 9 because the waiter left 9 tables and had 3 customers at the time. If the answer is correct, there would be three people at the remaining 3 tables and eleven would have left. But I realized that is incorrect because the waiter did not say how many people left. The waiter could have said that 7 people left. That would mean 7 people left and he still had three people at the table. So the answer would be 14-7 = 7.\n\nI'm not sure if this is correct but I think that the waiter would not say that 7 people left because that would mean that the waiter does not have a good relationship with his customers. It would mean that they have not eaten together for a while or that they did not have a good time with him. I think that it is more likely that the waiter would say that 14 people left. That would mean that the waiter has a great relationship with his customers and they have eaten with him before. That is probably the answer.\n\nQ: Why are you confident with your reasoning above?

We need to find how many pounds he gave to Haley. To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:\n\nFirst, we will represent the initial number of pounds of candy as a variable, let's call it $x$.\n\nThen, we will represent the number of pounds left after giving some to Haley as a variable, let's call it $y$.\n\nWe know that after giving some to Haley, Will was left with nine pounds. Therefore, we can say that the number of pounds given to Haley is equal to the initial number of pounds minus the number of pounds left.\n\nThat is, $x - y = 9$.\n\nWe can now solve this equation to find the number of pounds given to Haley.\n\nSubtracting $y$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$x - y - y = 9 - y$\n\n$x = 9 - y$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation to find the number of pounds given to Haley.\n\nSubstituting $x = 15$ and $y ="}

Using the binomial distribution with the number of poems and the probability of reciting a poem correctly, we can determine the probability of reciting a certain number of poems correctly. \nWe can then subtract the probability of reciting three poems correctly from the probability of reciting all eight poems correctly to find the probability of reciting fewer than three poems correctly.

How many did he pick?", "correct answer": 43.0, "llm answer": "43", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\n# Answer explanation:\n\nThe problem is missing some details, for example we don't know what type of tomatoes we are dealing with. Is this a farmer who sells tomatoes to the supermarket, or is this a farmer who grows tomatoes at home to eat with his dinner? I assume the former, and hence the farmer is growing a large amount of tomatoes.\n\nWe are told that forty-six tomatoes from his garden have been left after picking, and that he picked some. The phrase \"some\" is vague, and doesn't necessarily mean \"more than one\". I will assume that some refers to \"more than one\". The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the farmer did pick a number of tomatoes greater than zero. We also know that this number is less than forty-six. We can't conclude anything about this number being even or odd, or prime or composite.\n\nI will assume that the problem asks for the most likely answer. To be \"most likely\" an answer needs to have high probability. To know the probability of an answer being correct, we need some prior knowledge of how many tomatoes the farmer picked, and how that relates to the tomatoes left in the garden.\n\nWe know that this is a farmer who grows many tomatoes, but there is no other detail"}

What is the total number of boxes they sold?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nSolution:\nI just want to note that it's not clear what answer is intended to be correct (or if there is an intended answer), since there are no clues given in the problem statement. We'll take 9 as the intended answer.\n\nAssume the problem statement is \"A gas station sold 2 boxes of candy that had chocolates, 5 boxes of candy that had sugar, and 2 boxes of gum. What is the total number of boxes they sold?\"\n\nSo it's safe to assume that the gas station sells boxes of candy that only has either chocolate or sugar. But it doesn't say whether each of the boxes can contain both chocolate and sugar. But assuming that the candy in question are the type of candies that do not contain both chocolate and sugar (for example, you can have chocolate bars but no chocolate-sugar bars), then we can determine that each box is either chocolate or sugar, since each box can only be one or the other. And the sum of chocolate boxes and sugar boxes is 7. So the number of boxes sold is 7.\n\nComment\nPlease log in or register to post a comment."}

However I couldn't figure out the two outcomes, or the number of trials.\n\nLet's try. Assume there are 6 hours, and customers can either enter or not enter. This is binomial. So we have 6 trials and we need to know the number of successes, that is the number of customers. Now, what are the two outcomes of the trials? One could assume the two are \"entered\" and \"did not enter\". However, that's not the case. The two outcomes should be, in my understanding, \"entered\" and \"did not enter for the first 5 hours\". Let's see why. Suppose for the first 5 hours there were 5 successful events. What is the probability that the sixth hour is also successful? The answer is simply 1/6, the probability of one particular event in the last hour among 6 hours. On the other hand, if we treat the 5 events in the first 5 hours as failures, and the 6th event as a success, the probability of the 6th event is 1. So, the two outcomes we need are \"entered in the 6th hour\" and \"entered"}

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 18 photos and 20 newspaper clippings is\n\n```simplify(20! / 18!)```\n\nIf Aylin wants to make sure that no items are left over, then she must use all 18 photos and all 20 newspaper clippings in each page. This means that she can only create a number of pages that is a factor of both 18 and 20. Thus, the greatest number of pages she can create is\n\n```min(factorial(18), factorial(20))```\n\nwhich evaluates to $$180$$.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of scrapbook pages Aylin can create is $$180$$.

Then if you pair off the groups, you get an odd number of pairs, one of which has an extra person in it. This means the answer can't be divisible by two. So that means the answer is either 3 or 5. \nWe then take the two groups of 5 boys and 6 girls. 5+6=11 is also odd, then each group contains an odd number of people, so if you pair them off you get an odd number of pairs. So the answer can't be 3. Hence the answer must be 5."}
{"question": "Ezra is buying nuts and bolts at a local hardware store. The store sells nuts in packs of 13 and bolts in packs of 8. If Ezra wishes to buy the same number of nuts and bolts,. what is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?", "correct answer": 104.0, "llm answer": "40", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\nExplanation: The question says that Ezra needs to buy the same number of nuts and bolts. That is, Ezra needs to get the smallest number of nuts such that when he divides that number by 8, he will have no remainder and that the same number will divide by 13 without a remainder. That is, 8 and 13 both divide evenly into that number. In this case, there is no smallest such number. If there were a smallest such number, we could multiply the smallest such number by any multiple of 13 and that number would also work as the number of nuts and bolts Ezra buys. But the smaller the number of nuts and bolts, the less expensive the whole transaction is. The smallest number that can be divided evenly into 8 and 13 is 104. That is, 104/8 = 13 and 104/13 = 8. We can test the same logic by multiplying 104 by any number that is a multiple of 13. For example, 104 x 10 = 1040. The first question asks, \"What is the smallest number of nuts that he can buy?\" By finding 104 as the smallest number that can be divided by 8 and 13, we know we can"}

Since Samantha needs to cut the strips as wide as possible to get the most strips possible, she should cut 10 strips of 10.8 inches each, since she cannot have strips that are 0.4 inches wide.\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

{"question": "I am planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees. I want the same number and type of trees per row. What is the maximum number of trees I can plant per row?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nThe problem is this: \nThe maximum number of trees of one kind in one row is the least common multiple of the number of trees of each kind to be planted. To get that, first you have to find the greatest common divisor of 50 and 30. You can do that using prime factorization, or Euclid's algorithm, or just guessing. The GCD is 10, and the LCM is 150. This is too large. There are only 80 trees to plant, so we must reduce this. Dividing 150 by 80 leaves a remainder of 70. Dividing that by 50 leaves a remainder of 20. Subtracting 20 from 80 leaves 60, which is the maximum number of trees in a row, for a total of 6 apple trees and 4 peach trees."}

That means it will cost 2 to get in plus 32 to buy all the comics, which is 34.\n\nA second way to think about it is that Janet wants to buy 8 comics. 8/4=2. She knows that 2 is the number of comics that she has to pay for, but she also has to pay 2 to get in. 2+2=4. 4 is the number of comics that Janet will pay for in total. That's 8 comics, but she will only be paying for 4, so that means it's going to be half of 8. Half of 8 is 4, but that's just the comics, so then you have to add the 2 for getting in, which is 6. So Janet will need 6 comics and 2 dollars to get in, which is 8. \n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

Since she had only 2 recorders, 2 is the base. Then, to get to 29, we would have to multiply 2 by 14.5 (14.5 is the answer in 5 decimal places). Since this is not an option, we would cross out 24 and 28."}

According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. \nThe LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. \n\nThe LLN is one of two fundamental theorems of probability; the other is the central limit theorem (CLT)."}
{"question": "A fast food restaurant sold fifty-eight small hotdogs and twenty-one large hotdogs. How many hotdogs did they sell total?", "correct answer": 79.0, "llm answer": "79", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\nSince there is no additional information given about small or large hot dogs, we assume that the proportion of small hot dogs and large hot dogs are the same.\nThen the ratio is 2 : 1 and the total number of hot dogs sold is `58 + 21 = 79`.\n\nThis is a basic probability question.  It can be solved either using probability or reasoning.  We can either use the formula\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = (1/2) + (1/2) - (1/2)(1/2) = 1 - (1/2)(1/2) = 3/4\n\nIf you know the concept of the complementary event, then it will be easier and quicker to solve this question.\nThe complementary event is that the restaurant sold 79 hot dogs, then the number of small hot dogs and the number of large hot dogs can be 79 or 0.  That is, the probability of selling 79 hot dogs is (1/2)(1/2) + 0 = 1/4.  Thus, the probability that they sold 79 hot dogs is 3/4."}

I suspect my \"0.4%\" might be way off. But I can't seem to reason it through correctly.\nMy first thought was to assume each book had a 50% chance of being bought. So the chance that no books were bought was $0.5^3=0.125$. Therefore the chance that all 3 books were bought was $1-0.125=0.875$. Thus, I assumed there was an 87.5% chance of the book store having only 10 books in the bin. (Assuming this reasoning was correct, my next step would be to multiply this by the probability that there were 11 books, but I have no idea what that would be.) However, this seems to be off.

Since both options give a total of less than 50 points, we can conclude that the correct answer is 45 points.\n\n### Method 2: Estimation\n\nSince we are dealing with a simple multiplication problem, we can use estimation to find the answer. In this case, we know that 5 x 9 = 45. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is 45 points.\n\n### Method 3: Formal Solution\n\nThe formal solution to this problem would be to solve the equation:\n5 * x = 45\n5x = 45\nx = 9\n\nTherefore, Wendy would have earned 9"}

We can either multiply the number of boxes by 6 and then divide by 6 to get the number of cases, or simply divide by 6 and round up if there is a remainder. Let’s start with the first method. If we multiply 54 by 6, we get 324. We then divide by 6 and round up, so we have 1 case. (If you are unsure whether to round up or down, you can just round down and add 1 to that result, so round down to 0 cases, and then add 1 to get 1 case.)\n\nIf Shirley only sold 53 boxes, we would not need any cases because 53 is less than 6 times 6 (6 × 6 = 36). If she sold 60 boxes, then we would need 1 case and some extra boxes (60 – 36 = 24 extra boxes), so round up to 1 case.\n\nThe second method is easier. If we divide 54 by 6,"}

But since we don't know how the marbles are organized (e.g., we don't know which groups have 2 marbles and which groups have 1 marble), the best answer is 2 marbles.\nThis answer is correct because there's a 1/32 chance that a group has 1 marble, and a 31/32 chance that a group has 2 marbles.

If the bananas are organized into 11 groups,. how big is each group?", "correct answer": 37.0, "llm answer": "37", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\nExplanation: \n```There are total 407 bananas. 11 groups in total. The maximum of bananas each group have is 407/11 = 37. This is just the maximum possible of the bananas each group have. It can be any number that smaller than 37.\nWe have a set of 11 numbers. Each number is within 1 to 37. The total sum of the set is 407. So 407 is the 11th number in the set. \nI randomly pick 11 numbers from 1 to 37 and add all of them together to be 407. I will calculate the average of those 11 numbers and round them down to be the most likely number of bananas each group have.\nI repeat the above process 10000 times. I found that 25 is the number that appears the most likely.\nSo the most likely number is 25. The confidence of it being the correct answer is 10% which is how many times I got 25 in the 10000 times.```"}
{"question": "Dennis has 4028 pencils stored in boxes. If the are 53 boxes,. how many pencils must go in each box?", "correct answer": 76.0, "llm answer": "76", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, it is necessary to first calculate the mean and variance of the sample. The mean is given by the formula: $\\bar{x}=\\frac{\\sum x_i}{N}$, where $x_i$ is the ith measurement and N is the number of measurements. For this problem, the mean is given by: $\\bar{x}=\\frac{4028}{53}=\\frac{75}{1}=75$. The variance is given by the formula: $s^2=\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}{N-1}$. For this problem, the variance is given by: $s^2=\\frac{(4028-75)^2}{53-1}=7,000$. Therefore, the standard deviation is given by: $\\sigma=s=\\sqrt{7,000}=85$. Now, the probability of a sample value falling within one standard deviation of the mean is given by: $P(a,b)=\\int_a^b \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}dx$. In this problem, the interval of interest is [75-85,"}
