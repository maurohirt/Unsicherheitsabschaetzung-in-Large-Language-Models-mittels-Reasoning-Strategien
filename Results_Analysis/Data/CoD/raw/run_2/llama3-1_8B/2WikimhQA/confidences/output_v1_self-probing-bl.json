However, neither of Song Huizong, Song Qinzong and Song Rengzong had the Empress Zhen as his mother-in-law. However, Emperor Daozong is also the father of Song Zhezong, the son of Song Huizong, so he might be a father-in-law of Empress Zhen, if she married Song Huizong's son, then Empress Zhen is the mother-in-law of Emperor Tianzuo. Moreover, Emperor Tianzuo's mother was Emperor Daozong's daughter, so his father must be a son of Emperor Daozong, but not the Emperor Tianzuo's older brother Song Zhezong, because he was born after Song Huizong became an emperor and there is no record that Emperor Tianzuo had another older brother.

So, the answer is 1 in 6.\nNow, we have to find the probability of Fabia Eudokia being A's son-in-law. This is a little bit more difficult, but it is still possible to do it. We can use the conditional probability formula:\np(A|B) = p(B|A)*p(A)\np(B|A) = p(A|B)*p(B)\nSo, we can rewrite this as:\np(A|B) = p(B|A)*p(B)\n= p(A)*p(B)\n= 1/6 * 1/6\n= 1/36\nSo, the probability of Fabia Eudokia being A's son-in-law is 1/36.```"}

So I will simply assume that there is an extremely high probability that the questioner is fully informed about the situation. (A reasonable assumption given the question is posted to cs.stackexchange.com.)\n\nGiven that assumption, I believe there is a 100% chance that the answer is correct. This is because Catherine I was a morganatic wife of Peter the Great, and therefore would not have any children by him, let alone any mother-in-law. I think that the questioner is either misremembering an older version of the question, or has invented a fake question. (It seems that the real question is \"What is the mother-in-law of Catherine the Great?\")\n\nThe reason I am certain about my answer is that I have done a lot of reading about the Romanovs, and so have a very good knowledge of the situation. In particular, I have read \"The Romanovs: The Final Chapter\" by Peter Kurth, which is a very detailed book on the"}

There's a very simple rule that can determine the correct answer. This rule is stated in my answer for [Who is Humphrey Of Montfort's father?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyHistory/comments/12u1a7s/who_is_humphrey_of_montforts_father/). In the other question, I stated the \"Humphrey\" is \"not\" Humphrey de Bohun (the husband of Joan of Kent). Based on that rule, the correct answer would be \"Jane Plantagenet\". Because if her father is the Earl of Kent, she would be the Earl's daughter, who was married to the Earl of Essex. This is not the case. Her father is the Earl of March.\n\nThere is a possibility that you misread the question. The question is talking about the paternal grandmother, not maternal grandmother.\n"}

This is because the parents would probably want to give their child the same name as his aunt.
