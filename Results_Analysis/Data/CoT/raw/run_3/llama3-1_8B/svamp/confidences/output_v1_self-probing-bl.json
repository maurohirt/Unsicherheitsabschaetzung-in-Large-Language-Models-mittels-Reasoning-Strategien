{"question": "Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack. How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?", "correct answer": 51.0, "llm answer": "51", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nExplanation: \n```\nThe number of packs of DVDs we buy is denoted by n, which is unknown. The cost of each pack is 76 dollars. So, the total cost is 76n. A discount of 25 dollars on each pack means that we pay 76n-25n dollars for n packs of DVDs. Since 51 dollars is the number we have to pay, we get the equation 76n-25n=51. Solving the equation, we get n=1, meaning that we bought one pack of DVDs.\n```"}

How many chairs do they have in the backyard?", "correct answer": 143.0, "llm answer": "143", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": " 10%\n\nExplanation:\n\nAs it is a \"word problem\", we will translate the question into math.\n```\nnumber of tables = 11\nnumber of chairs in each table = 13\nnumber of chairs in the backyard = x\nnumber of chairs in the backyard = 11*13 = x\nx = 143\n```\nAs the above answer is the only answer choice we can choose, we just pick it as the answer. So, the confidence is 10% in this case.\nThe key to a problem like this is to identify if you can actually solve the problem or not. There is no actual algebraic formula to solve for the number of chairs if you do not know the number of tables or the number of chairs per table. So, your confidence in this case should be much lower than you might have initially thought.\nThe second key to solving problems like these is to recognize that this is a \"word problem\" and you are expected to read the entire problem and make the translation to the proper math. If you do not read the entire problem, you may miss information or not recognize information that you may know how to solve.\n\nQ: If you roll a six-sided die, how likely are you to roll a number less than or"}

The answer is indeed -363, which is 617-523.\nIf there is no difference between the number of erasers and the number of crayons, then we can have two hypothesis (Ho and Ha) about the distribution of erasers and crayons. If we assume a 95% confidence interval, then we have 5% possibility to see an error on the data, meaning we have 5% probability to not get the true value.\n\nWe will now calculate the z-score, which is defined as the difference between the number of erasers and crayons divided by the standard deviation, which in this case is sqrt (457*617) = 111.85, giving us z = (-363 / 111.85).

{"question": "Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while 489 suggested adding bacon to the menu. How many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: The first step in answering this question is to find the difference between the number of students who suggested bacon and the number who suggested mashed potatoes. To find this difference, subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes from the number of students who suggested bacon. 10. This is the answer.\nThe second step is to evaluate the likelihood of this answer being correct. To do this, we need to know the probability distribution of the sample sizes. This is given in the problem statement. The sample size of students who suggested bacon has a binomial distribution with parameters $n=479$ and $p=0.5$, and the sample size of students who suggested mashed potatoes has a binomial distribution with parameters $n=489$ and $p=0.5$. Therefore, the probability of answer 10 to be correct is given by\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Answer 10}) &= \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\\\\n&=\\frac{479!}{(479-10)!10!}(0.5)^{10}(0.5)^{479-10}\\\\\n&=0.0254"}

How many friends can she invite?", "correct answer": 95.0, "llm answer": "85", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nAnswer: 85\nExplanation: Let’s solve this problem by using equations. The following will show you how to do this using the equations. Let’s use the letters x and y to represent the unknown quantities we will solve for. x represents the number of packages Carol bought and y represents the number of extra invitations she bought. Since she bought 14 invitations per package and bought 6 of them, we know x * 14 = 6. We can write the equation x * 14 = 6 for this situation. We also know y = 11 because she bought 11 extra invitations. Since Carol bought 14 invitations per package and x packages, we know y = x * 14 – 6. We can write the equation y = x * 14 – 6 for this situation. Now we have two equations. We can solve for x and y using these two equations: x * 14 = 6 x * 14 – 6 = y x * 14 – 6 = 11 We can use substitution to solve the first equation for x. x * 14 = 6 x = 6 / 14 x = 0.428571428571429 Now we can substitute this value for x into"}

So, there must be cakes left and now if we subtract 78-31=47, it does not match the total cake (170).

How many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than there are now?", "correct answer": 23.0, "llm answer": "-23", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet x be the number of children on the bus before the bus stop. Then, 18 is the number of children on the bus after the bus stop. So, the number of children that got off the bus is\n\nx – 18. Hence the problem becomes\n\nx – (x – 18) = 41 – 18 or\n\n2x – 18 = 23 or\n\n2x = 41. Hence x = 20.5 which is not an integer. So there are more children on the bus after the bus stop than before the bus stop. The answer is -23.\n\nSo the answer 41 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some children got off the bus. Then there were 18 children left on the bus. How many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than there are now? is -23.

Therefore, the number of crayons lost/given away was 253 - 183 = 70.\nThis reasoning is logically correct. However, there is no way to tell how many crayons Paul had at the beginning and how many were lost/given away without more context.\n\nThe confidence rating is 0% because there is no way to know how many crayons Paul had at the beginning and how many were lost/given away without more context.

We use the first sentence (1) and the second sentence (2).\nThe first sentence (1) states that 26 bird families came to live near the mountain, so the number of bird families that came to live near the mountain is 26.\nUsing this number and the second sentence (2), we can figure out how many bird families were left near the mountain.\nWe know that 26 bird families came to live near the mountain, so before the arrival of the 26 families, the number of bird families that were living near the mountain was $$26 - 2 = 24$$. So, 24 bird families were left near the mountain after the arrival of the 26 families."}

So Jill must have 14 peaches less than Steven and Jake must have 18 peaches less than Steven. Jake already had 18 peaches less than Steven before Steven had the extra peach. So Jake must have 18 + 14 peaches less than Steven so Jill must have 5 peaches.\n\nA more formal way to explain would be that Jake had 18 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 19 peaches, Jake had 19 - 18 = 1 fewer peach than Steven. Thus, Jill has 1 less peaches than Jake.

So we have to solve\n\nx+14=31\n\ny+14=93\n\ny-x=79-12=67\n\nfor x and y. So x=19-14=5 and y=93-14=79.

This is my first question here and I know this is a difficult question to answer but if you could help me it would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThe following is a step-by-step solution to this problem: \n\n1) Start by assuming that all 11 customers were still there at first and subtract 3 from 11.

How many drums of grapes would be filled in each day?", "correct answer": 18.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nReasoning: 266 / 5 = 53.2 pickers per day. 53.2 pickers fill 90 drums a day, so 90 / 53.2 = 1.6968 drums of grapes filled per picker per day. This is 5 drums per day, as we know from the question. Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\nSolution Explanation: This reasoning is clear and concise, but it is a bit hard to follow for the reader. The calculation would have been clearer with an extra line for the calculation of the number of pickers per day, but this is a small detail. \n\nThe reasoning is mostly correct, but it is missing a key assumption that 1 picker fills 1 drum per day. There is no evidence given in the question that this is true. Without this assumption, the reasoning cannot be used to justify the answer. Therefore, this reasoning cannot be used to conclude that the answer is correct.\n"}

How many beads did Emily have?", "correct answer": 52.0, "llm answer": "52", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\nThis is a problem about linear combination, with 26 linear combinations and 2 elements (beads and necklaces) for each linear combination. For example, we can consider the 26 linear combinations as 26 linearly independent vectors in a space with 2 axes, where the first axis is the number of necklaces and the second axis is the number of beads. Each point in this space corresponds to a specific number of necklaces and beads, and we can calculate the number of beads using linear combination: \n```number of beads = 26 * number of necklaces + 2 * (number of beads - 26 * number of necklaces) = 26 * number of necklaces + 2 * number of beads - 52 * number of necklaces = 26 * number of necklaces + 2 * number of beads - 26 * number of necklaces = 2 * number of beads = 52``` \nTherefore, the number of beads is 52, which is the same answer as the one provided by the question.\n"}

How many cookies does each bag have?", "correct answer": 9.0, "llm answer": "Each bag has 9 cookies.", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nSolution: You can use the same technique to calculate the probability of the correct answer as before.\nThe total number of possible combinations is $4^6$. That’s because you can put 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 cookies in each bag, and there are 6 bags.\nAmong all those possible combinations, the number that have 9 cookies per bag is ${6\\choose 2}^4 = 15 \\times 15 \\times 15 \\times 15 = 50625$. That’s because, you have to first choose the two bags with 9 cookies, and then the two bags with 6 cookies, and repeat this process for 3 more pairs of bags.\nSo the answer is $50625/4^6 = 75\\%$.\nYou can also work with the conditional probability: first choose the two bags with 9 cookies, then choose 2 more bags with 9 cookies, then choose 2 more bags with 6 cookies, then choose 2 more bags with 0 cookies. All this gives the same answer.\nThe answer also works with 7 cookies. In that case, there are 7 choices for the first bag, 6 choices for the"}

The probability of finding the second bottle cap is also p, but we don’t know how many bottle caps there are after finding the first bottle cap. So the probability of finding the second bottle cap is p(1 − p) + p. We don’t know how many bottle caps there are after finding the second bottle cap, so the probability of finding the third bottle cap is p(1 − p)(1 − p) + p. And so on.\n\nThe probability of finding 7 bottle caps is p(1 − p)7 + p(1 − p)6 + … + p(1 − p)1. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 1 − p. The sum of this series is\n\np(1 − p)7 + p(1 − p)6 + … + p(1"}

We could proceed as follows:\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Katie has a total of $$62+80=142$$ games. Her friend has a total of $$73+41=114$$ games. Thus, the total number of games that Katie and her friend had is $$142+114=256$$. As there are two people, each of them had $$\\dfrac{256}{2}=128$$ games. From this information, we know that Katie’s friend had $$73$$ new games. Thus, her friend had $$128-73=55$$ old games.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $$\\boxed{55}$$.\n\nConfidence: 1%\n\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

If the answer is 64, there are 228 - 64 = 164 remaining items. Since the ratio of cake:pastries of all items are 167:61, the ratio of remaining cakes to remaining pastries should be proportional to their ratio to the number of all items, which is 167/61 * 228/164 = 167/61 * 7/8 = 23/8. The number of remaining cakes should be 23/8 * 64 = 23 * 8 = 184. 228 - 184 = 44, which agrees with the number of pastries sold.\nSo, the answer should be 64.\n\nComment:\nThe probability of answer 64 to be correct can be computed by counting the number of combinations (that fit the condition) over the total number of combinations: C(228, 108) / C(228, 44)."}

How many bird families were left near the mountain?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\nQ: How likely is the answer of 14 to be correct? Show your reasoning concisely.\n\nAnswer: \n```1) There are 27 families that migrated, and we have 41 families initially, so the number of families left must be 41 - 27 = 14. 2) Winter is almost here, so it's more likely the families that migrated are more migratory than the families that didn't migrate. Therefore, families that migrated are more likely to be migratory than the families that didn't. 3) If most families are migratory, the chance of them migrating to warmer countries is high, so the chance of them staying is low. The chance of them staying near the mountain is 0.4 (40%) 4) Therefore, there's a 0.4 (40%) chance that all the families that remained are migratory. But then, 0.4 * 27 = 10.8, which is not an integer, so we round it up to 11 families, meaning 14 - 11 = 3 families are non-migratory. Therefore, the chance that there are 3 families that remained is 0.3 * 0.4 = 0"}

We can then use the answer to determine the number of sacks harvested over 26 days.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of sacks of oranges harvested per day. We know that there are 28 sacks of ripe oranges and 52 sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day. This means that there are a total of 80 sacks of oranges harvested per day.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of sacks of oranges harvested over 26 days. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\n$$Number\\ of\\ sacks\\ harvested\\ =\\ 80\\ \\times\\ 26$$\n\n$$Number\\ of\\ sacks\\ harvested\\ =\\ 2080$$\n\nTherefore, over 26 days, a total of 2080 sacks of oranges will be harvested.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is 2080."}

The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet. How deep was the water?\n\n1) We are given that \"Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron\" and \"Ron stands at 13 feet\" therefore \"Dean stands at 22 feet\".\n\n2) We are given that \"The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height\" and we know Ron's height to be 13 feet, therefore the depth of the water is 208 feet. [Let me know if you need further clarification on this step]\n\n3) From 2, since Ron stands at 13 feet and the depth of the water is 208 feet, therefore the distance between the water's surface and the water's bottom is 195 feet.\n\n4) From 1 and 3, since Dean stands at 22 feet and the distance between the water's surface and the water's bottom is 195 feet, therefore the water was 173 feet deep.\n\n5) Since the answer is asking for the depth of the water, therefore we can simply state the answer as \"173 feet"}

If you don't read carefully, the two statements will be seen as: 52 campers went rowing in the morning; 61 went rowing in the afternoon. As a result, many people may think that the answer is $61 - 52 = 9$. However, if you read carefully, you will find that the question is asking how many more went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning, which is $(61 - 52) - 0 = 9$. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\n## Solution 2\n\nSince the afternoon has more campers than the morning, the correct answer must be positive. And, since there are more campers in the afternoon, the answer must be a positive number smaller than the difference between the two numbers of campers (61-52). Therefore, 9 is the correct answer.\n\n## Solution 3\n\nIt is asking how many more went rowing in the afternoon than in the morning. Therefore, the answer is 9.\n\n## Solution 4\n\nThe problem is asking for how"}

We need to figure out how many white t-shirts she buys. In each package, there are 53 white t-shirts. So, we need to multiply 53 by 57. Since we know that 57 is 1.07 times 53, 57 is about 107% of 53. We can multiply 53 by 107 to get 5689. We know that there is 1 white t-shirt left over, so there are 5689+1 white t-shirts in 57 packages.\nShe also buys 34 packages of trousers. We don't know how many trousers are in a package, but we know that there are 34 packages. We need to figure out how many trousers she buys. We can use the same idea we used above. Since 34 is 1.38 times 53, 34 is about 138% of 53. We can multiply 53 by 138 to get 7314.

I'll say there are 100 people moving in, and 50 moving out. That means that the number of people in the school at the end of the day is the same as the number of people in the school at the beginning of the day, plus 100, minus 50, which is 150.
