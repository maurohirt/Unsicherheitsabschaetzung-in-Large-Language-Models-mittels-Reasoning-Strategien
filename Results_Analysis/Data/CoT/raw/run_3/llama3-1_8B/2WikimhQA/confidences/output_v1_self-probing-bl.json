Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was a son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, a Roman general and statesman. He was born in 99 BC. According to Plutarch, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was married to a woman named Quinta Servilia, and they had a daughter named Claudia Caecilia. Therefore, we can say that the mother-in-law of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was Claudia Caecilia.\n\nHowever, there is also another possibility, which is that the mother-in-law of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer was Julia Caesaris, the daughter of Julius Caesar and Cornelia. Julia Caesaris was married to Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, and they had a son named Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, who was the father of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer.

The only name that fits this description is Elizabeth Ruthven. The evidence to confirm this answer is that John Lyon's birth date is 1380, which is the same as Elizabeth Ruthven's, the year of her marriage to David Lindsay, the second Earl of Crawford. This means that John Lyon must have been the son of Elizabeth Ruthven by her first husband, David Lindsay, the first Earl of Crawford. Therefore, John Lyon's paternal grandfather must be Elizabeth Ruthven's father, who is the third Earl of Crawford, Alexander Ruthven. The above reasoning is supported by the fact that John Lyon, 3rd Lord Glamis, was the first Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland, and the first Earl of Crawford, Alexander Ruthven, was the chief of Clan Lindsay."}

The next two lines says that the king had a son and that the son was a son-in-law of Shiban Khan. Shiban Khan is known to have married to a princess and therefore the son must have married to a princess as well.\n\nThe next line says that the son had a daughter named Saray Mulk Khanum. The daughter was also called Saray Mulk Khanum. The last line of the question says that the daughter, who had the same name as the paternal grandmother of Shiban Khan, was the daughter of Shiban Khan's son.\n\nThe daughter's name is the same as the paternal grandmother of Shiban Khan. Shiban Khan's paternal grandmother had two sons. If Shiban Khan's son has a daughter named the same as Shiban Khan's paternal grandmother, it must be the case that Shiban Khan's paternal grandmother was the paternal grandmother of Shiban Khan's son.\n\nSince Shiban Khan had two sons, the daughter must be the paternal grandmother of Shiban Khan's younger son. This means that the daughter's father is the younger son of Shiban Khan. It follows that the younger son of Sh"}

Thomas Fitzgerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, is believed to be the son of Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond, who is known to have had five children. As Maurice FitzGerald was a prominent figure in Irish history, his family connections and relationships are well-documented. In particular, the FitzGerald family played a significant role in Irish politics and warfare during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nIn terms of the paternity of Thomas Fitzgerald, there is no definitive evidence to suggest who his paternal grandfather may have been. However, based on historical records and family tree information, it is possible that Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Desmond, was his paternal grandfather. The FitzGerald family tree indicates that Maurice FitzGerald had several children, including an older brother named Thomas FitzGerald, who is known to have been alive during the same time period as Thomas Fitzgerald. It is possible that Thomas Fitzgerald, the 7th Earl of Desmond, was the son of Maurice FitzGerald and his wife, Joan FitzGerald."}
