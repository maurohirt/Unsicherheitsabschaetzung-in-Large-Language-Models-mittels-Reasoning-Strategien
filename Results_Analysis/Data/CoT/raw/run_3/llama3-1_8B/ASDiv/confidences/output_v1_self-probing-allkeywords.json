The statement \"2 beavers were working on their home\" does not specify whether they were working on the same home or separate homes. Similarly, the statement \"1 went for a swim\" does not indicate whether the swim took place before or after the other beaver left the home. The additional information provided does not provide enough context to determine which answer is correct.\n\nIn order to provide a correct response, it is essential to ask clarifying questions to gather additional information. For instance, one might ask if both beavers were working on the same home, and if the one that went for a swim left before or after the other beaver left the home. These questions would help to provide the necessary context to determine the correct answer.\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to consider that the original question may have been intentionally phrased in such a way as to test the reader's ability to think critically and analyze the provided information.

January has 31 days.\nTherefore, the sister's birthday is January 31 + 14 = January 34 (th). This is impossible because there is no 34th day in a month. The month ends with a 31st day, and the next day would be the 1st day of the next month. Therefore, the next day for January 31 would be February 1, and not February 34.\nSo, the possible answer, January 34, is incorrect.

How many more does Brian have?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "Bryan has 30 more candy pieces than Ben.", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nMy reasoning: The most direct way to use these keywords is to look at how many candies are in the two different pieces of candy. The question states that Bryan has 50 pieces of candy, so if I know how many Ben has, I can subtract Ben's number of candy pieces from Bryan's number of candy pieces to find out how many more Bryan has. The keywords 30 tell me that Bryan has 30 more candy pieces than Ben, and so the answer is correct. The confidence is 80% because the keywords are very direct and there is no evidence that the keywords might be incorrect."}

First, add up the eggs found in the club house, town hall garden and park: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20. Since the twins found 20 eggs in total, the most likely answer to the question is 20. However, since the question asks about \"how many eggs they have in total\", and the eggs are not all in the same place, it is also possible that the twins have more than 20 eggs in total.

We know that there are 235 students who liked the new menu and 165 students who did not, and if we sum these two values, we get 400.\nAdditionally, if Sofia conducted the survey a week after the new menu was introduced, it is likely that most students who did not like the new menu would have responded that they did not like it. This is supported by the fact that only a relatively small number of students liked the new menu (235), suggesting that the majority of students did not like it. Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the students who took part in Sofia's survey did not like the new menu.\nTherefore, based on the given information and the reasoning provided, the answer of 400 appears to be the most likely correct answer."}

This allows for the equation\n`40 cm^2 = 5 pans`\nIf the surface area of one cookie is 64 cm^2, then the surface area of all cookies combined must equal 40 cm^2. We can then use this equation to find how many cookies are on 40 cm^2.\n`x(64) = 40`\n`x = 0.625`\nTherefore, there are 0.625 cookies per cm^2. In order to find how many cookies there are on 40 cm^2, we can divide 40 cm^2 by 0.625 cookies per cm^2.

How many minutes did it take Johnny to run 10 laps?", "correct answer": 3.3, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.655, "probing response": "65.5%\n\nReasoning: First we can reason that Johnny ran 3 laps per minute, and if Johnny ran 10 laps, then 30 laps took 10 minutes, thus the first possible answer is wrong, because the relationship between the 2 statements is inconsistent. So the possible answers are 5, 10, and 20 minutes. \n\nNext we reason that if the question is asking about minutes, then the answer must be a number of minutes. We can reason that 30/3 = 10, and the answer 10 is a minute number, so the answer must be 10. This is reasoning with math.\n"}

How many hours did she spend on her science project?", "correct answer": 5.0, "llm answer": "5", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98%\n\n**Explanation**\nFirst, let's do the math to calculate the answer, which should be easy. It's 5 hours.\n\nNow, let's look at what we can learn from keywords. We can tell that the question is about how many hours are there in 300 minutes, because we can get this information from the question stem itself. But we also know that the answer choice is actually just a number (5), which is probably not enough for us to make a decision.\n\nLet's look at the options more carefully. The question is asking us to identify the number of hours in 300 minutes. This means that we need to know what 5 represents (hours), but we don't have any information about that. So, it's not very likely that we can use any of these options to answer the question correctly.\n\nWhat we do know is that there are two types of hours: standard and non-standard (e.g., 24:00). Since there aren't any specific numbers used in any of the answer choices, it seems like there must be some kind of conversion going on here, which makes it even less likely that we can use any of these options to answer the question correctly.\n\nOverall, I think that this question is most likely incorrect"}

If the sale price is 20% off the regular price,. what was the sale price?", "correct answer": 480.0, "llm answer": "$480", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nThe correct answer to the question is actually $480. This can be solved by first solving the fraction \"20% off\" to a decimal: 0.2. If this number is multiplied by the cost of the television, $600, you get $120, which can be subtracted from the original price. This is 0.2 × $600 = $120 = $600 − $120 = $480. \n\nThis question is similar to the 1/3 off problem. The first step is to convert the 20% off into a fraction which is 1/5. Next, you want to find the product of the fraction and the regular price. Then you can find the price with the fraction and subtract it from the regular price.\n\nThere was also another error in the problem. It stated \"Mrs. Hilt wants to buy a television that regularly costs $600.\" This should have read \"Mrs. Hilt wants to buy a television that regularly costs $600, but she wants to save 20% off the regular price.\"\n\nFinally, I think that this problem is well suited for the task. The only things that make it hard to solve is that it is an unknown variable problem. However, once the equation is known"}

{"question": "A factory produced 50 printers and 21 scanners. After 41 of the printers were sold, it produced another 16 scanners. How many printers and scanners did the factory have in the end?", "correct answer": 46.0, "llm answer": "9 printers and 37 scanners", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\nThe answer is 9 printers and 37 scanners. If the factory starts with 50 printers and 21 scanners, the factory has 9 printers left in the end. The factory also produced 16 scanners after 41 printers were sold. The number of scanners is the number of printers + the number of scanners produced. Hence, the total number of printers and scanners is 9 + 16 = 25. The total number of printers and scanners at the beginning is 50 + 21 = 71. Therefore, there are 71 - 25 = 46 printers and scanners that were sold. Since 9 of the printers were sold, the factory has 9 printers left. There are 71 - 9 - 25 = 37 scanners left. Thus, the answer is 9 printers and 37 scanners.\n\nQ: What is the maximum number of scanners that the factory produced in the end?\nKeywords during reasoning to the possible answer: ['50 printers and 21 scanners', '41 printers', '16 scanners', '9 printers and 37 scanners']\nConfidence: 100%\nThe maximum number of scanners that the factory produced in the end is 16.

{"question": "A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day,. how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: The washing machine is fully loaded at 200 pounds of clothes. If the washing machine is not fully loaded, the number of pounds is less than 200 pounds, since the amount of clothes to be washed decreases. To determine how much less, we set up the following proportion:\n\n$\\frac{200 \\text{ pounds}}{28 \\text{ pounds}} = \\frac{x \\text{ pounds}}{200 \\text{ pounds}}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 28 pounds and dividing both sides by 200 pounds, we get that $x = 4$ pounds.\n\nThe correct answer is $4$ pounds.\n\nConfidence: 100%\nExplanation: We know that the machine is fully loaded at 200 pounds. To find how many pounds are washed per day when it is not fully loaded, we will set up the following equation:\n\n$28 x = 200$,\nwhere $x$ represents the number of pounds of clothes washed per day. Solving the equation for $x$ gives us $x = 7$.\n\nThe correct answer is 7 pounds.\n\nConfidence: 99.9%\nExplanation: We can solve this problem by plugging the answer options into the equation $28 \\text{ pounds} ="}

Since the number of days that the bottle lasts is 250, the number of vitamins in one day is x×250=12, or x=12/250. Hence, after the bottle runs out, the number of vitamins that Gil takes per day is (12+2x)=12+2(12/250)=12+0.24=12.24. The correct answer should be 0.24."}

The ratio is given in the form (a : b). This indicates that for every a oranges, there is b oranges. This is not a direct relation like \"4 good oranges, for every 1 bad orange\".\nIn this case, the value of a is 3. This means that there are 3 good oranges for every 1 bad orange. Now to find the number of bad oranges, the value of a must be multiplied by the number of good oranges.\nThe number of good oranges is given to be 24.\n24 is multiplied by 3 to give 72. However, the ratio is 3:1, and not 3:3. Therefore, this result is not the correct answer. Instead, 72 must be divided by 3 to give 24. This is the correct answer."}

Half of that, i.e., 4 beanie babies are given to sister. 36 beanie babies are given to needy children. And, she kept 12 for herself. So, total beanie babies given to needy children and to sister is 40, which is 4/10 of total collection, i.e., total beanie babies is 100.

So, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.\"\n\nThe confidence of 99% can be calculated as follows. First, the number of keywords that support the answer is three: ['95 - 87 = 8 pounds', '95 + 8 = 103 pounds', '103 - 8 = 95 pounds']. And there is no keyword that counteracts the answer. So, the number of positive keywords that support the answer is three. Second, the total number of keywords is five: ['95 - 87 = 8 pounds', '95 + 8 = 103 pounds', '103 - 8 = 95 pounds', '95 pounds', '95 pounds']. The ratio of the number of positive keywords to the total number of keywords is $\\frac{3}{5}$ and it can be also rewritten as 0.6. So, the probability of the answer to be correct can be calculated as $\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$. Finally, 0.6 is rewritten as 60%. Thus, the confidence of 99% can be calculated as: $0.99 = 60\\% + \\epsilon$. Here"}

The difference in numbers are the same as the difference in pairs of shoes in two weeks (27-12 vs 15-12). I also feel that it is more likely for 41 pairs of shoes to be sold than 53 pairs.

An employee is surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles last week.\nWhat is the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold?\nAs each box of soap contains 5 bars, the number of bars sold must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, the number of bars sold is a multiple of 5, and the number of bottles sold is also a multiple of 19.\nTo find the smallest number of each type of soap that the shop could have sold, we can start by looking at the LCM of 5 and 19, which is 95. This means that the shop could have sold 95 bars of soap and 95 bottles of soap.\nHowever, as the employee was surprised to discover that the shop sold the same number of bars and bottles, we know that the actual number of bars and bottles sold must be less than 95.

{"question": "Trevor counted 77 coins in his bank. He counted 29 quarters. The rest are dimes. How many more coints of the total than quarts does Trevor have?", "correct answer": 48.0, "llm answer": "19", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: To make the calculation easy we start by adding the quarters and dimes together, which gives us the total number of coins. \n29 quarters + 48 dimes = 77 coins\nNow, we subtract the number of quarters from the total number of coins to find how many more coins Trevor has than quarters. \n77 coins - 29 quarters = 48 more coins\nNote that the number of quarters, 29, appears on both sides of the equation, and can be canceled out. \n48 more coins\n"}

This is not the answer.\nAs Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis, Dennis should have $70+45 = 115$ marbles, and Kurt should have 115-45 = 70 marbles. This is not the answer.\nAs Laurie has 12 more marbles than Kurt, Kurt should have $70-12 = 58$ marbles, and Laurie should have 70+12 = 82 marbles. Since Kurt has 25 marbles, Laurie should have $82-25 = 57$ marbles.\nSo, my answer is 57 marbles. However, this is not one of the answers, therefore, I will eliminate this answer."}

How many comic books did Scott and Sam sell?", "correct answer": 65.0, "llm answer": "Scott and Sam sold 32 comic books.", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nReasoning: In the problem, the context is clear that Scott and Sam had 90 comic books altogether before selling, and after selling they only have 25 comic books. Given this, we can use the fact that they had a total of 90 comic books, and after selling they had 25 comic books, which means they must have sold some of the comic books they had before. The possible answer of Scott and Sam selling 32 comic books is not correct because it does not make sense. If they had 90 comic books before selling and after selling only had 25 comic books, then they must have sold more than 32 comic books to reach the number of 25 comic books.

How many apples did Billie find?", "correct answer": 34.0, "llm answer": "34", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\n\nExplanation:\n```As Matthew found 46 big red apples, the probability of Billie finding a big red apple is equal to the probability of him finding 1 apple. We have, P(Billie find big red) = P(Matthew finds 1 big red) = 46/80. Thus, if Billie finds an apple, the probability that it is big red is 46/80 and the probability that it is not big red is 34/80. As Billie has some apples, the answer is not zero. Thus, we need to calculate the probability of Billie finding the same number of big red apples. We can use the law of total probability to calculate this probability. P(Billie finds big reds) = P(Billie finds big red) * P(Billie has the same number of big red) + P(Billie finds not big red) * P(Billie has the same number of not big reds). Let x be the number of big red apples Billie finds. As x is random, we need to calculate the probability that Billie finds exactly x big red apples. P(Billie has x big reds) = C(80, x) * "}

Todd is running around the track in 88 seconds. Since he has been running longer than Todd and at the same speed, Todd should be at more than 100% of the way around the track.

If I have a quarter, that's 25 cents, so there are some unknown number of quarters (call it 25 cents) and some unknown number of nickels (call it 5 cents). If I have 12 in total, that means $25 + 5 = 12$. If I have 6 nickels, that's 30 cents. This is less than 12, so 6 is incorrect. I can check to see if any other answer is correct.\n\nSo, to answer this question, one should first reason about how many nickels and quarters are being talked about, then reason about how many nickels are in the coins to be considered, and then finally reason about whether the answer is correct. The reasoning process is quite complicated, involving several different pieces of information. For example, one might reason about the difference between a quarter and a nickel as 25 and 5 cents respectively, or think about how a total of 12 coins adds up to 25 + 5 cents.

What was the total number of questions on the test?", "correct answer": 50.0, "llm answer": "200", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nSolution: To calculate the total number of questions on the test, we need to find the total number of correct and incorrect answers. We are given the ratio of correct answers to incorrect answers is 7:3, and the difference between correct and incorrect answers is 20. To find the total number of questions, we need to first find the total number of correct answers and then find the total number of incorrect answers. Let's say the total number of correct answers is 7x and the total number of incorrect answers is 3x. We are given that the difference between correct and incorrect answers is 20. Therefore, 7x - 3x = 20, which means x = 20. Hence, the total number of correct answers is 7x = 7(20) = 140, and the total number of incorrect answers is 3x = 3(20) = 60. Since the total number of questions on the test is the sum of the total number of correct answers and the total number of incorrect answers, we have: Total number of questions on the test = 140 + 60 = 200. Therefore, the total number of questions on the test is 200.\n\nQ: Considering these keywords"}

How many grams of trail mix did Noah have left?", "correct answer": 3400.0, "llm answer": "11,280 g", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem statement tells us that Noah made 12 kg of trail mix, and his family ate 8600 g of it. This tells us that 12 kg - 8600 g = 12800 g of trail mix was left over.\n\nReasoning to the Possible Answer:\nThe possible answer, 11,280 g, is obtained by rounding 12800 g to the nearest 10 g. Rounding in this way means that the rounded value lies somewhere between 12,000 g and 11,280 g. Therefore, the number of grams of trail mix left over, which is 12800 g, is closer to 11,280 g than 12,000 g. This explains why the possible answer, 11,280 g, is given.\n\nOther Possible Answers:\nOther possible answers include 12,000 g, 11,000 g, 10,900 g, and so on. However, only 11,280 g is rounded to the nearest 10 g, which is the reason why it is included as a possible answer.\n\nJustification:\nIn a problem like this, the answer should be as close as possible to the value given in the problem statement.

{"question": "While sorting some beads, Jenna put 74 beads in the first jar, 83 beads in the second jar, 92 beads in the third jar, and 101 beads in the fourth jar. If this pattern continues,. how many beads will Jenna put in the fifth jar?", "correct answer": 110.0, "llm answer": "110", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n\nExplanation: To find how many beads there will be in the fifth jar, we need to determine if there is a pattern and find out the next number in the pattern. We can see that the beads in the first jar have 7 more than the beads in the second jar, the beads in the second jar have 9 more than the beads in the third jar, and the beads in the third jar have 9 more than the beads in the fourth jar. We can see that 7, 9, and 9 are all odd numbers. We can also see that the number of beads in each jar is always 1 more than the last number. In other words, if there are 101 beads in the fourth jar, there will be 102 beads in the fifth jar. 102 is an even number, but the numbers in the first four jars are all odd numbers. Thus, the pattern is not continuing and there is not a predictable number of beads in the fifth jar. Jenna probably will not know how many beads to put in the fifth jar. This answer is less likely to be correct."}

What is the greatest number of groups Daniel can display?", "correct answer": 11.0, "llm answer": "47 groups", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: In the given problem, 44 commemorative plates and 33 commemorative spoons should be displayed in groups, with the same combination of plates and spoons in each group. The greatest number of groups can be determined by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 44 and 33. The GCF is the largest positive integer that divides evenly into both numbers. To find the GCF, we can use prime factorization.\n\nPrime factorization of 44: 2 x 2 x 11\n\nPrime factorization of 33: 3 x 11\n\nThe GCF is the product of the common prime factors, which in this case is 11. Since 44 is greater than 33, the GCF must also be a factor of 44. Therefore, the greatest number of groups that can be formed is 44 / 11 = 4. This means that Daniel can display 4 groups of 11 commemorative plates and 11 commemorative spoons.\n\nExplanation 2: The problem states that Daniel wants to display his plates and spoons in groups, and the keyword \"same combination\" implies that each group should have the same number of plates and spoons.

Since Carmen doesn't want to leave any lollipops, we can assume that she would use all of the available cherry lollipops in each bouquet, which means that there must be at least one cherry lollipop in each bouquet. Since Carmen wants to create identical bouquets, we can assume that all of the bouquets have the same number of cherry lollipops. Since Carmen has four cherry lollipops, we can assume that the number of bouquets must be a factor of 4, so the possible answers are 1, 2, and 4. However, if Carmen creates only one bouquet with all four cherry lollipops, she will have no orange lollipops left to make any more bouquets, so we can rule out the answer of 1.

But we can see the same reasoning as before: first page with the first card, 2nd card and last card; second page with the 3rd card, 4th card and last card. Again, there are 2 pages with 7 cards each.

There are 9/2=4.5 movies on each shelf if it's distributed evenly. The owner wants each shelf to have the same number of movies, so the total number of movies on the shelves must be divisible by 2. Since 9 is not divisible by 2, the owner needs to add more movies until the total is divisible by 2. Since 9+3=12 and 12 is divisible by 2, the owner needs 3 more movies to make sure each shelf has the same number of movies. The correct answer is 3/2.```\nI think this answer is correct because it makes sense.

Thus, there are 2 birds not yet in the nests. \n\nExplanation: In general, we can not directly deduce the difference of 2 values from the difference of 3 values. In this problem, we notice that 3 nests and 6 birds are divisible by 3, so it is natural to think that maybe we can think about the difference of 6 and 3 using the difference of 2 and 1.\n```# For every 3 birds, there is 1 not in the nest\n# For every 2 nests, there are 1 birds not yet in a nest\n# For 3 nests, we have 3 birds not in a nest.\n# For 6 birds, we have 2 nests not yet occupied.\n# So we can deduct that there are 3 birds and 2 nests left to distribute\n# Then we can deduce that there are 3 birds that are not in nests and there are 2 nests that are not occupied.\n```"}

However, the keywords don't provide how many flowers are more than bees. Instead, it provides two sets of numbers. One for the number of flowers and one for the number of bees. By deductive reasoning, since the keywords show that there are 5 flowers and 3 bees, the answer is 5-3=2 which is the number of more flowers than bees.\n```If I could have more words to provide reasoning, I would like to say that this reasoning is a deductive reasoning, and the answer is logical because it is based on the information provided in the question and keywords, and the conclusion is 2 flowers that are more than bees.```"}

We are going to use the keywords to help.\n\nNow the question says that the chef had **forty-six apples** and **after** making pies, he had **fourteen** left. So the initial number of apples minus the leftover apples will be the answer. We get **forty-six apples - fourteen apples = thirty-two apples**. So the difference between the number of apples before and after making pies is **32 apples**. This answer is a little bit trickier than the other questions because there are no keywords like *'the first' or 'first time'* to make us think that the order of the answers matter. So we have to make sure that we understand what the question is asking before we choose an answer.\n\nNow we will think about how likely it is that this answer is the correct one. If it's correct, it will be 100%. Otherwise, it's 0%. And since we are given three answers to choose from, one of the answers is the right one.

The first was 2 pounds, the second was 3 pounds and the last was 13 pounds. What's the difference between the weight of the first box and the third box?``` \n\nI think it is 3 pounds.\n\nFirst, I see \"Oliver was weighing boxes\", it is a noun phrase with past continuous tense, which suggests that \"Oliver\" is the actor of the verb \"weighing\" and \"boxes\" is the object of \"weighing\". Thus, I can deduce that Oliver is the person doing the action and boxes are the things that Oliver is doing the action with.\n\nSecond, I read \"the first\" and \"the second\" as quantifiers, which describe the relationship between \"the first\" and \"the second\" and the object of the sentence. So, I know that there is a relationship between \"the first\" and \"the second\" and between \"the second\" and \"boxes\".\n\nThird, I understand \"The first was 2 pounds, the second was 3 pounds\" as a pair of phrases, which suggests that \"The first\" and \"The second\" are similar or related to each other.

Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "Lewis is 9 years old and Brown", "confidence": 0.98, "probing response": "98.0%\n\nExplanation: As the age difference of Lewis and Brown is constant, i.e., 9 years, we can assume that Lewis will turn 10 years old in three years. So, Brown will be 20 years old in three years. Then, Lewis is 9 years old and Brown is 16 years old. This fits the constraints well, i.e., the ratio 1:2 and 3:5 are correct. We have very little room to move this ratio and keep it intact. So, the answer is 9 and 16, or, 9 and 15, but we chose 9 and 16 to reduce the complexity of the problem as it doesn't have another constraint.\n\nSolution: Let Lewis' and Brown's age be L and B, respectively.

Then, the length is $w+7$.\nThe perimeter of the wall is $2(w+7)+2w=2w+14$. We know $2w+14=98$, or $w=44-7=37$ and thus $w+7=44$.\n\nLength = 44 ft, Width = 37 ft\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf the length and width were both equal, the building would be square. Since the length is 7 feet greater than the width, it's reasonable to assume that the building is not square. This would mean the perimeter is twice the width plus twice the length. Since the perimeter is known, this will help us calculate the width.\n\nFirst, we'll find a formula to calculate the width.\n\n$98 = 2w + 14 + 2(w + 7)$\n\n$98 = 2w + 14 + 2w + 14$\n\n$98 = 4w + 28$\n\n$70 = 4w$\n\n$w = 17.5$\n\nThe width is 17.5 feet.\n\nNow, to calculate the length, we'll subtract the width by 7 feet.\n\n"}

The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 3 cups of sugar. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?\n\nWe can start with the given keywords: ['9 cups', '2 cups']. \nFirst, we try to find out whether the number of cups Mary put in and the number of cups in the original recipe is more than, less than or equal. \nWe look for clues of what the numbers represent (are the quantities of things counted, or is the number the amount to pay?), the unit and the direction of the change (increase or decrease). The keywords ['2 cups'] indicate the amount Mary has added. The keywords ['9 cups'] are from the original recipe. The unit is ['cup'] and there is a negative direction of change. This means Mary has added 2 cups of flour, and she needs to add ['more flour']. \nWe look for clues about the keywords. ['more flour'] is a description of what we need to add. ['more'] indicates the direction of change. The unit is flour. \nNow, we need to figure out the amount of what"}

In that case, $392$ students would travel by bus, $28$ students would travel by car, and $396$ students would travel in total.\n\nThere are several ways to find the answer using only the information given in the problem statement.

We can write this as\n\\[x = 5y\\]\nWe want to solve these equations to get an answer for the cost of a bicycle and a bicycle helmet. We can do this by eliminating one of the variables. We will eliminate the variable $x$. We can multiply the first equation by 5 to get\n\\[5(x + y) = 5(240)\\]\nWe can use the distributive property to simplify this equation. We"}

The perimeter is 150 meters.", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n```Comment: [short description of confidence reasoning, keywords used]```\nAnswer: Confidence: 100%\n```Comment: We have all the information we need. Given the perimeter is 96 meters, if we subtract 68 from the perimeter, we have 28 meters left. We can find that this is the same perimeter as the length, so the length must be 68 meters. If the length is 68 meters, we know the width must be 68-14, or 54 meters. Now that we know the length and width are 68 meters and 54 meters, we can just multiply to find the area. 68*54=3640 m^2, which is 36 km^2, so it is not 36 meters. If you said the dimensions were 82 meters by 68 meters, you can see that the perimeter of this rectangle is indeed 150 meters. 82+68+68+82=300, which means that the perimeter is 150. If you think the dimensions are 68 meters by 82 meters, you can see that the perimeter of this rectangle is also 150 meters. 68+82+82+68=300, which means that the perimeter is 150"}

But, the actual rectangle is 20 yds long. So, we cannot make a rectangle from that long ribbon. Thus, 21.33 yds is not a possible length for the ribbon.

How many extra pieces of junk mail will they have if they give each truck the same amount?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\nReasoning: I have to add 11 to all of the numbers that have the 2 digits in the same order of the first one. \n\nI know the problem requires evenly split between the 7 trucks so that means each truck has to get the same amount of junk mail. \n\nI know the total amount of pieces of junk mail is 582, so I divide 582 by 7 to get 83 because 582 divided by 7 is 83.\n\nNow, I think about what I know about 582. I remember 582 is 83 multiplied by 7. I know 83 multiplied by 7 will give me 583. \n\nSo, in conclusion, each truck will get 83, that will mean 583/7. The question is asking for the number of extra pieces of junk mail. I know 583 divided by 7 is 83 but I also know 583 divided by 7 is 583/7. I have to get the difference between the 583 and 583/7, which will be 83 - 583/7, which is 11, so 11 is my answer."}

The correct answer is therefore 2 × 3 = 6 square inches.\n\nHowever, the possible answer given is also 6 square inches, which may seem correct at first glance. This is where the keywords come in. By considering the keywords in the question, we can see that the book had a specific length and width. If we apply this knowledge to the possible answer, we realize that the width of the book is 3 inches, but the possible answer does not specify the length of the book. This means that the possible answer is not sufficient to determine the area of the book, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, the confidence in the possible answer of 6 square inches being correct is 0%, since it is not a sufficient answer to the question.\n```6 square inches: 0%```"}

What is the height of the envelope?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6", "confidence": 0.3, "probing response": "30%\n\nExplanation:\n```Inches are unit of measurement, as the statement said that the envelope is 6 inches wide, we can use that information as the width. Therefore, we are given the width (6 inches), but we need to find the height. We can use the information of the total area (36 square inches), which is the multiplication of width and height, to find the height. However, we have no idea how tall is the envelope, it may be 6 inches, 7 inches, etc. As such, we need to use the keywords to find the height. \n\nThe statement said the envelope is 6 inches wide, 1 inch could be a unit of measurement for the height as well. So we have two possible answers: 6 and 1. With the information of the total area, we have the multiplication of width and height, which is 36 square inches. Therefore, to get the answer, we can calculate 6 x height. If the height is 6 inches, then the multiplication would be 6 x 6, if the height is 1 inch, then the multiplication would be 6 x 1. To choose the correct answer, we can calculate both the multiplication and compare the multiplication with the"}

How many action figures total could his shelves hold?", "correct answer": 27.0, "llm answer": "27", "confidence": 0.2, "probing response": "20%\n\nExplanation: \nI'm 20% sure this answer is correct. Here's why: \n\n1. The question is asking about Adam's shelves, which have three shelves. However, there's no information about how many action figures Adam actually has in his room.\n2. It seems unlikely that Adam would have enough action figures to fit nine on each shelf, since that would be over 100 total action figures. It's possible he could have 18 or more, but 27 seems excessive. \n3. The answer choice gives us a total of 27 action figures, which means each shelf would have to have nine action figures. This seems like a lot, especially since there's no indication that Adam's shelves are unusually large or that he has particularly small action figures.\n4. The answer choice doesn't specify whether the action figures are arranged in any particular way on the shelves, so it's possible they could be arranged so that only some of them are visible. However, it seems unlikely that Adam would arrange his action figures in such a way as to make it difficult for people to see all of them.\n5. The fact that the question includes the word \"fit\" suggests that the action figures should be tightly packed together on the shelves. If they"}

The distributive property states that if a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c. If we distribute the \"four people\" term, we can say that a * b = a * b + a * c, where a is the term \"four people\" and b and c are the terms \"each passenger\" and \"take eight pieces of luggage\" respectively. Therefore, we can say that a = b + c, which means that \"four people\" is the same as \"each passenger\" plus \"take eight pieces of luggage\".\n\nWe can now answer the second question by using the additive identity property. The additive identity property states that if a + 0 = a, then a is the additive identity. If we apply the additive identity property to the term \"four people\", we can say that a + 0 = a, where a is the term \"four people"}

However, we don't know if Olivia's dad took everyone else out as well.

It doesn't seem like Olivia's dad would be taking her and her friends out, so he probably took himself as well. Olivia's dad probably paid for the whole meal as well, which makes it very likely he paid for 3 meals. \n"}

If only 6 dressed up,. how many people didn't wear costumes?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "7", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nThe problem with this answer is that it has the right information, but doesn't have the correct calculation. The problem with this reasoning is the fact that 7 people don't wear costumes seems unlikely because the ratio between people who didn't wear costumes and people who did was equal to 7 and not 6 (the correct ratio is 7/6).\n\nHowever, this problem is very easy to solve when you use math. The problem statement tells us that 6 people dressed up, and the number of people total is 13. This means that the total minus the ones who dressed up is the number of people who didn't.

However, we don't know what operation we should use to get to the correct answer, so this is a common way to make a mistake. In this case, we can check for other answers first. \n\nWe can know for sure that 47-4≠43 because if 43 is 4 less than 47, then 47 should be 4 less than 43. It is impossible to have a 4 gap between 43 and 47. So we need to rule out 47-4=43. If we can make this elimination, then we know for sure that it is not the subtraction that will make 43 less than 47.

How many pounds did he give to Janet?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10 pounds", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nExplanation:\nGiven the problem, we are first asked to show reasoning concisely. First, we notice that we are asked about \"Halloween\", which tells us that we are going to have something to do with the number of pounds of candy, Janet giving, and pounds of candy left. Thus, we can assume that the question is related to addition and subtraction, and the problem has two variables that we need to find. Thus, we can assume that $x$ is the number of pounds that Janet gave and that $10$ is the difference between the total pounds of candy given to Janet and Oliver and the pounds left. That is $10 = 78 - x$.\n\nQ: Now we are ready to determine the probability. Please answer with the following format:\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer 10 pounds to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 90%\n\nExplanation:\nAs we have mentioned in the previous step, the question has two variables.

{"question": "A fast food restaurant had ninety-nine hotdogs. After selling some they had ninety-seven left. How many hotdogs did they sell?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "2", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0\n\nExplanation:\nThe keyword information about the amount of hotdogs that were sold (2 hotdogs) provides information to determine whether there are enough hotdogs left to sell.\nFrom the question, we can tell that the restaurant started with 99 hotdogs and that it sold some. This implies that after the sale, it had a lower number of hotdogs than it started with.\nAfter the sale, the restaurant had 97 hotdogs left. Since 97 < 99, this implies that the number of hotdogs that the restaurant sold must have been positive (i.e. > 0), which means that the restaurant must have sold more than 0 hotdogs.\nAdditionally, since the difference between 97 and 99 is 2, this means that the number of hotdogs that the restaurant sold must have been equal to 2, which is the second choice.\nThus, we can conclude that 2 hotdogs must have been sold.\n\nExplanation:\nConsidering the information about the keywords and the choices given, the answer is 2. This is because the keywords indicate that the answer involves subtraction. Specifically, the restaurant had 99 hotdogs, and after selling some, it had 97 left. To determine how many hotdogs were sold, we need"}

The question asks for the total number of milks taken. There are 2 choices of milk, chocolate and strawberry. 2 students chose chocolate, which is 2 out of the 15 who chose strawberry. Therefore, the number of students who chose chocolate is 2/15 and the number of students who chose strawberry is 15/2. There are also 3 who chose regular milk. The number of students who chose regular milk is 3/4 of the number of students who chose milk. If we add these three values, we have 2S/15 + 15/2S + 3/4S, where S represents the total number of students who chose milk. Therefore, the correct answer is 2S/15 + 15/2S + 3/4S.\n"}

The human brain is actually good at identifying the keywords that matches the sentence (the question). For example, here the sentence only has 1 \"tickets\", thus, any answer with more than 1 \"tickets\" is less likely to be correct. We can also see this from the question. The only information we have is the amount Debby spends on each item. There is no other information, therefore, we can conclude that the answer is most likely to be related to the 2 tickets, 10 tickets, and 2 tickets. Since only answer 14 has these keywords, it should be the most likely answer. However, as humans, we tend to be biased, so I want to set a very high threshold here, that's why I set the confidence at 99%.\n\n**What's next?**\n\nNext, I will build a model to mimic the human brain, which can automatically identify the keywords, and make decisions like human."}

One where you want to minimize the number of apples, and the other where you want to minimize the number of grapes. You can use the same method to solve both problems. The first thing to notice is that Edeena is only allowed to pack a whole number of apples and a whole number of grapes. So for the first case, if you assume that you pack the minimum number of apples, then you know that you need to pack at least 18 apples. If you then consider the second case, and assume that you pack the minimum number of grapes, you know that you need to pack at least 9 grapes. However, since you need to pack a whole number of apples and a whole number of grapes, the only way to do this is to pack 18 apples and 9 grapes. So the answer is 9. \n\nWhen you consider the keywords from the question, you can see that 18 is the smallest number of apples that Edeena can pack in groups of 18, so the answer must be 9.\n\nWhen you consider the keywords from the question, you can see that 18 is the smallest number of apples"}

Therefore the number of snack bags can be found by dividing the total number of chocolate candy bars and cookies by 2, which is 15 snack bags in total. It is impossible to maximise the number of snack bags without having to use all the chocolate candy bars and cookies. Therefore, the number of snack bags is 6.\n\n2. The number of chocolate candy bars is divisible by 2 and the number of cookies is divisible by 2.

If Tim has 33 sweets, then Peter has to have 1 sweet in the tray, which is also impossible, so the largest possible number of sweets in each tray is 9.```\n\n```Confidence: 90%```\n```Reasoning: In this scenario, there are two people and two types of sweets. Peter has more sweets than Tim and they have to divide the sweets equally between the two of them, so there will be no remainder. Also, they can only have either orange-flavoured or grape-flavoured sweets in a tray, but not both. Based on these conditions, I think the largest possible number of sweets in each tray is 9, because that is the largest number that can be divided evenly by 2, and it will give Peter the least number of sweets in the tray.```\n\n```Conf"}

This method can help achieve the maximum number of strips that are equal in width from either bolt without any fabric waste. In this case, we divide the width of the bolt by 2, giving us 22.5 inches, which is the same width for each strip when the halving method is applied to both bolts.

On the other hand, if there is a question \"how many students there are in the classroom\" and the answer is \"35 students\", then you know that the number 35 is a part of the \"unit\" students.

Let's first think about the number of enemies you have defeated altogether: You say you have defeated all but 2 of them, and there were 6 enemies total. This means you have defeated 4 enemies.\n\nNow, we know each enemy defeated gives you 3 points, and you've defeated 4 enemies. To get the total number of points you earned, we can use multiplication:\n\npoints earned = number of enemies x points earned for each enemy\n= 4 x 3\n= 12\n\nThis tells us that the answer is 12 points.\n```Confidence: 90%```\n```Confidence: 85%```"}

Please also explain your answer clearly.\nCorrect Answer: 108\nExplanation: According to the question, Adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed, and he had 12 lawns to mow, but forgot to mow 8 of them. So he only mowed 4 of them and earned 4*9 = 36 dollars. However, since he had 12 lawns to mow, if he mowed all of them, he would earn 12*9 = 108 dollars. Therefore, the correct answer is 108."}

You might want to clarify that. \nAnyway, here's how I would do it.\nWe're given that Peter has 54 tickets and 4 pencils, and he gives 9 tickets to 9 friends. The keywords say that 54 ÷ 9 = 6 and that 4 pencils remain. From these facts, we can deduce that each friend gets 6 tickets and 0 pencils. So far, that seems like a pretty likely answer.\nBut there's another possibility. Suppose each friend gets 4 tickets and 2 pencils. Then Peter would have 10 pencils left over instead of 4. This could be a plausible interpretation of the keywords \"4 pencils\". However, the problem says explicitly that Peter has 4 pencils, not 10, so I'd say this interpretation is less likely than the first one.\nSo my best guess is that the answer is \"Each friend gets 6 tickets and 0 pencils.\"\nI'd give myself"}

The number of groups (77) is not given in the question. We can use 11 as the number of groups, but 11*5929 = 65219, which is bigger than the total number of Skittles. Then, we can conclude 11 is too big and the number should be lower. 5929 can also be divided by 7. 7*5929 = 41603, which is smaller than the total number of Skittles. Then, we can conclude 7 is too small and the number should be bigger. Since 11 is bigger than 7 and the possible answer, we can conclude 7 is the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### Wrong Answer:\nConfidence: 60%\n### Explanation:\nThere are 5929 Skittles and 11 erasers in Steven's collection.

In this case, the numerator is the number of bottle caps, which we are given, and the denominator is the number of boxes, which we are also given. The question asks us to divide the bottle caps among the number of boxes. This indicates that we need to find the value of the number of bottle caps divided by the number of boxes, which is simply the value of the denominator.\n\nFor problems like this, we can also consider what the question is asking, and think about the information we are given and what operations we need to do. In this case, the question asks us to divide the number of bottle caps among the number of boxes.
