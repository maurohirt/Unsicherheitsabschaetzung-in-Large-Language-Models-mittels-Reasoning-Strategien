Please first show your reasoning concisely and then answer with the following format:\n```Solution: [your solution, include the numerical number, not in percentage]%```\nSolution: 80%\nReasoning: The question asks for the number of balloons that Allan brought to the park. We can reason that if we take the total number of balloons that Allan brought to the park and subtract the number of balloons that Jake brought to the park, the result should be equal to the number of balloons that Allan bought at the park. Therefore, we can use this formula: X - 4 = 3, where X is the number of balloons that Allan brought to the park. Solving this equation gives us X = 7."}

How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation: We know from the question that there are 2 birds sitting on the fence. We also know that 5 more birds and 4 more storks joined them.\nSince there were already 2 birds on the fence, the total number of birds after the 5 more birds and 4 more storks joined them is 2 + 5 = 7 birds.\nSimilarly, the total number of storks after the 5 more birds and 4 more storks joined them is 0 + 4 = 4 storks.\nTherefore, the difference between the number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 7 birds - 4 storks = 3 more birds than storks."}

The problem asks for the number of books still need to be read.\n  2. Subtracting 19 from 62 is equivalent to multiplying 34 and 1.26470588235294 (i.e. 43 / 34). So we need to multiply 34 by 1.26470588235294, which is 43 + 34.\n  3. The problem provides two numbers (i.e. 43 and 34). So you need to find the number that is 1.26470588235294 (i.e. 43 / 34) times 34. So 1.26470588235294 times 34 is 43 + 34."}

Also the term'rest' is a little tricky. Is it 700 or something else?\n\nThe first thing is to identify what the question is actually asking. There is no mention of the total number of pupils, only the number of girls and then the number of boys (142 more boys than girls). It seems that we are supposed to answer for the number of girls and boys together.\n\nHow can we figure out the number of girls and boys together?\n\nIn a school there are 700 girls and the rest are boys.\n\nThe term rest is usually used to indicate a number. The number is not given explicitly in the question. But the number of girls is given. So, the number of girls and the number of boys should add up to a number. This should be the total number of pupils. This is what we get from the question\n\nGirls + (rest) = total\n\nSo we have,\n\n700 + rest = total\n\nThis gives us the total number of pupils.

{"question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 106 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 242 t-shirts. If they sold 115 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. How many t-shirts did they sell during the Texas tech game?", "correct answer": 127.0, "llm answer": "117", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\n\n\n**Answer Explaination:**\nTo calculate the number of shirts sold during the Arkansas game, we take 242 - 115 = 127.\n\nThe question asks us to use the information \"2 t-shirts\" to arrive at the answer. I believe the answer to the question to be \"127\" as a result. My reasoning is as follows:\nWhen Razorback t-shirt shop made 106 dollars off each t-shirt sold, they made 115*106=11930 dollars during Arkansas game, and 127*106=13258 dollars during Texas Tech game. During the two games, they made 25188 dollars off 242 t-shirts. Therefore, each shirt is 25188/242=104.31 dollars. This is close to the value of 106 dollars per shirt sold during each game. In conclusion, Razorback t-shirt shop sold 127 t-shirts during Texas Tech game."}

Since it is 2 chapters each with 405 pages, it is a total of 810 pages.\n2. 810 pages divided by 664 days gives an average of 1.22 pages per day.\n3. So if you read the 2 chapters at the same rate, it would mean each chapter had to have 1.22 pages per day.\n4. We are asked to find the answer that is closest to the 1.22 pages per day.\n5. Amongst the 4 possible answers, the only answer closest to 1.22 pages per day is 332 pages per day.\n\nThe above answer would be correct only if there are no other keywords to consider in the question.

{"question": "There are 3941 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4950 erasers. If the erasers are organized into 495 groups. How big is each group?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nReasoning: I think the word 'group' is very important here. Because it is very likely that each group has a constant size. So I'm going to do a back of the envelope computation.\nSo I have 4950 erasers, and there are 495 groups. So on average, the size of each group is 4950/495. However, in the worst case, each group can contain up to 4950 erasers. So there are 495 groups of 4950 erasers, and 0 groups of 0 erasers. So the median of all the groups is 2457. So if the problem states that \"the erasers are organized into 495 groups\", we can be sure that all the groups are equal, and their size is 2457. Because we're asking for the \"size of each group\", not \"the median size of each group\". \nTherefore, I guess the answer is 10.\nThe confidence is 60%. This is because there are cases that the problem statement could be different from what I said here. For example, the problem statement could be: \"Steven has 4950 erasers, and they are organized into 495 groups. Each group has 10 er"}

Then, as stated, Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, which means Dean is 1 foot shorter than Ron. Since Dean is 11 feet shorter, Dean is 1 foot shorter which means Dean is 11 feet + 1 foot = 12 feet shorter which is Ron's height. Therefore, Dean is Ron's height, which is 12 feet. Then, based on the information, I found out that the water was 5 times Ron's height which is 5 times 12 feet. 5 times 12 feet is 60 feet, however I have to take the information of Ron standing at 12 feet. Since Ron is standing at 12 feet and the water is 5 times his height which is 60 feet, then the water is 60 feet - 12 feet = 48 feet from the bottom of the water.

The keyword '34 books' implies the total number of books but it doesn't give any clues to how many books are in each bookshelf. ```\n\nQ: What are other answer choices?\n```Answer Choices: [all possible answers, including the correct one]```\nAnswer Choices: [17, 34]\n\nQ: Which answer choice are you most confident to be correct?\n```Most Confident Answer: [answer number]```\nMost Confident Answer: 2\n\nQ: How did you reach the answer? Please describe your thinking process in one or more sentences. (Optional)\nMy thinking process is as follows: First, I am thinking 17 as the answer since 34/2=17. However, I think the first question 'Bryan took a look at his books' is not useful and there are two bookshelves in total, so the answer choices should be 17, 34, or 17+34. Hence, the answer is most likely to be 34 and 17 is also a possible answer.\n"}

How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?", "correct answer": 149.0, "llm answer": "149", "confidence": 0.01, "probing response": "1%\nExplanation:\n```We have:\nArea of the floor: 11 x 15 = 165 square feet\nArea already carpeted: 16 square feet\nArea of remaining floor to be carpeted: 165 - 16 = 149 square feet```\nThe area of remaining floor to be carpeted, as suggested by the author, is 149 square feet. Therefore, the answer is 149 square feet.\nThis answer is incorrect because the problem asks to \"find how much more carpet is needed.\" Since carpet was already used to cover 16 square feet of the floor, the total area of carpet needed is 149+16 = 165 square feet, not 149 square feet."}

So it can be easily inferred that Steven has 8 fewer apples than Jake. (If Steve has 20 apples, then Jake must have 20+8=28 apples) Similarly, Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. So it can be easily inferred that Steven has 6 more peaches than Jake. (If Steve has 16 peaches, then Jake must have 16-6=10 peaches) So we know that Steve has 10 peaches and 8 apples. So Steve has 10-8=2 more peaches than apples. Hence it is most likely the correct answer."}

By just observing the number of crayons left, I can't really eliminate any of them, so I have to try to further eliminate them by analyzing the numbers in the question. Firstly, I know that \"x minus 315 equals 291\" is equivalent to \"291 plus 315 equals x\" (because \"minus 315\" and \"plus 315\" are opposites). So the second answer \"606\" is now gone. Now I have to think if there's any other way to eliminate another possible answer. I know that \"minus a number\" and \"multiply by a number\" are both inverses of each other, so it's like \"minus 315\" can be \"times 3\". The first answer, \"945\" is now gone. Now, I know that \"minus 315\" and \"divide by 3\" are both inverses of each other, so \"minus 315\" can also be \"divide by 3\". The third answer, \"189\", is now gone. Lastly, now the question is simplified to the second question in the prompt. After solving the question, I found that \"divide by "}

If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries. We can make two equations, one for cakes and one for pastries, and set the number of pastries made to be x. So, we have 115 + x = 126 and 81 + x = 48.

If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries, we can solve for the number of pastries made.

To achieve that, all of the friends must be equal in number. If the number of friends was not equal, it means the number of friends who did not get 6 crackers (not equally shared) will increase. For example, if there are 7 friends, Matthew can only share 5 crackers equally among 5 friends and the remaining 2 crackers to another 2 friends (6+6+5+5). Therefore, the most reasonable assumption is all friends must be equal in number and each friend must get the same number of crackers. \n\nWith this assumption, we now only need to consider two answers: 6 and 8. We can further reduce the number of answers because Matthew gave 36 crackers to his friends, not 34. Therefore, we can rule out 8 as the answer and only 6 remains. The answer is 6."}

My reasoning is as follows:\nIf the question asked for the total number of bottles of soda, the answer would be 79 + 53 = 132. This means that the question must be asking for the difference between the number of bottles of regular soda and the number of bottles of diet soda.\nSo, the question is essentially asking for the difference between the two numbers. The keywords 79 bottles, 53 bottles, and 26 give us some information about the number of bottles of regular soda and the number of bottles of diet soda. Based on this information, we can conclude that the number of bottles of regular soda is 79 and the number of bottles of diet soda is 53. Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 79 - 53 = 26.\nOverall, my reasoning is that the answer to the question is 26, because the question is asking for the difference between the number of bottles of regular soda and the number of bottles of diet soda.

{"question": "Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 11 friends. How many crackers did each person eat?", "correct answer": 2.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation:\n\nIn this task, there are 22 crackers, which we can denote as C and 34 cakes, which we can denote as C'. Since Matthew gives equal numbers of crackers and cakes to 11 friends, each person would have received C/11 crackers and C'/11 cakes. To make the problem easier to solve, we can first find the total number of crackers and cakes that were given away. Therefore, C+11C/11=C'=11C/11+34=11(C'+C)/11+C', which can be simplified to give C'=11C. Now, we know that the total number of crackers and cakes that were given away is equal to 11C. Since Matthew originally had 22 crackers, we can conclude that he gave away 11 crackers to his friends and the 11 friends each ate one cracker. Hence, 11 crackers were eaten in total. Therefore, we can see that the correct answer to the problem is 11.\n\nIt is important to note that while the question does not specify what kind of answer we should expect, we can assume that the answer will be a positive integer.

How many apples were there on all trees initially?", "correct answer": 33.0, "llm answer": "15", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nReasoning: Since all 3 apple trees have 8 apples each, that means that all trees have a total of 24 apples. Since Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree, and each tree had 24 apples, that means that Rachel picked all the apples that were on the tree. Therefore, Rachel picked 24 apples from the apple trees and the trees now have a total of 9 apples on them. In order to find the number of apples that were on the trees initially, we need to find the number of apples that Rachel picked minus the number of apples that are now on the trees.

{"question": "For Gwen's birthday she received some dollars. She spent 8 dollars and has 6 dollars left with her. How much money did Gwen receive for her birthday?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "$14", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nReasoning: As Gwen received money and spent, this must be a decrease process. As it is a decrease process, Gwen must have spent money she had less than or equal to what she had before. This means that the number of dollars Gwen had spent can not be bigger than the number of dollars Gwen had at the beginning. This gives us an upper bound for Gwen's initial number of dollars. We can also conclude that Gwen has $6 dollars left, and $8 dollars has been spent, therefore $14 dollars has been received. As there are no other clues that would suggest a number less than 14, the answer is $14 with probability 100%. \n\nNote that the above reasoning may not be the correct reasoning, but it will help to narrow down the correct answer."}

To answer this question, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the total amount of money Dan has. Then, we need to subtract the cost of the chocolate from the result. This way, we can find the answer.\n\nWe know that Dan has $4. The cost of a candy bar is $7, so we need to subtract $7 from $4 to find out how much Dan has left. $4 - $7 = $-3. So, Dan has -$3 left after buying the candy bar.\n\nNow, we know that Dan has -$3 left after buying the candy bar. The cost of a chocolate is $6, so we need to subtract $6 from -$3 to find out how much money Dan has left after buying the candy bar and the chocolate. -$3 - $6 = -$9.

The first sentence tells us that David did 40 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore David did 40+Zachary push-ups.\n2. The second sentence tells us that David did 17 less crunches than Zachary. Therefore David did (Zachary-17) crunches.\n3. The third sentence tells us that Zachary did 34 push-ups.\n4. The fourth sentence tells us that Zachary did 62 crunches.\n5. So we have David did (Zachary+40) push-ups and (Zachary-17) crunches. From (3), we know that (Zachary+40)=34+40=74. Therefore David did 74 push-ups. From (4), we know that (Zachary-17)=62-17=45. Therefore David did 45 crunches.\n6. So David did 74 push-ups and 45 crunches. It means that David did (74-62=12) more push-ups than crunches."}

How much does she weigh now?\nI think the answer is 51 kilograms because if you start with 71, and you lose 20, then 71 - 20 = 51. 51. \n\nHowever, if we assume that the question is asking what Jessies current weight is in relation to her starting weight, and not what her current weight is, then I think the answer is 51 kilograms. \n\nTo solve this we have to take into consideration two pieces of information: that Jessie started at 71 kilograms and lost 20 kilograms, and that we are looking for the current weight relative to the starting weight. \n\nIf we assume that Jessie started at 71 kilograms and lost 20 kilograms, then her current weight would be 51 kilograms. \n\nBut if we take into account the additional information that we are looking for the current weight relative to the starting weight, then we can use a proportion to find the answer. \n\nIn this case, we know that Jessie started at 71 kilograms and lost 20 kilograms, so we can set up a proportion like this:\n\n71/20 = x/51, where x is the current"}

When the 2 new action figures were added, it can be assumed that the first 2 new action figures added were to the shelf that had the n action figures, which would give a total of n + 2 action figures. When 7 action figures were removed, I assume it is 7 different action figures that were removed. Then the remaining total number of action figures on the shelf would be n + 2 - 7 = n - 5 action figures, which means n - 5 = 10, so n = 15.

Here's the reasoning:\n1. At the beginning Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet.\n2. She visited a supermarket, where she spent some money (I don't know how much).\n3. After visiting the supermarket, she went to a showroom and spent 49 dollars there.\n4. At the end, she had 26 dollars left in her wallet. \n5. From (1) and (4) she must have spent 106 - 26 = 80 dollars on her visit to the supermarket.

With the keywords, we reason as above, but simply say that we already know the amount (i.e. Olivia spent 31 dollars at the supermarket).

Then he makes 76 more cakes, bringing the total number of cakes to 186. However, the question asks how many cakes the baker would still have after making the 76 more cakes, which implies that the baker kept the original 110 cakes and made 76 new ones.

The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?```\nIf we first subtract the number of cups of sugar from the number of cups of flour, then 13 - 6 = 7. However, we know that we still need 8 more cups of flour than sugar, so 7 - 8 = -1. This means that Mary still needs 1 cup more of flour than sugar, which would mean she needs to add 14 more cups of flour to her recipe.\n```Mary is baking a cake.

{"question": "Paco had 36 cookies. He gave 14 cookies to his friend and ate 10 cookies. How many cookies did Paco have left?", "correct answer": 12.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\nExplanation: \"Paco had 36 cookies.

We are told that Dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone, and after deleting some apps and files he has 5 files and 12 apps left.

Then, we can subtract the number of apps that Dave has from the total number of apps he had initially, which gives us 24-12 = 12 apps that Dave has left. Finally, we can subtract the number of files that Dave has left from the total number of apps he has left, which gives us 12-4 = 8 apps that Dave has left.

This problem can easily be solved with a calculator and the keyword '1/3'. However, the problem can also be solved by using a multiplication rule with the keyword '8.82', so the problem is quite versatile.\n\nReasoning\nThe total number of pages in the book is 594. There are three chapters, so the number of pages in each chapter must be 594/3. However, we are told that Frank finished the book in 607 days. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter must be less than 594/3.

It seems to me that the total amount of pieces of junk mail for the 78 blocks is 38x78=2976 and there are 19 houses in one block so 2976/19=156. Thus, each house gets 156 pieces of junk mail."}

This implies that all of the `3 snakes` were not hiding. If we subtract the number of snakes that were hiding from the total number of snakes (82 - 3), we get the number of snakes that were not hiding. \n\nSince there were 82 snakes hiding, there were 3 snakes not hiding.\n\nTo find the number of alligators not hiding, we can subtract the number of alligators that were hiding from the total number of alligators (19 - 19) = 0. \n\nTherefore, there were 0 alligators not hiding.\n\nWe can also use logic to reason about this problem. If all of the snakes were hiding, then none of the snakes were not hiding. If 82 snakes were hiding, then the total number of snakes must be 82. Since we are given that there were 3 snakes not hiding, we can subtract this number from the total number of snakes to get the number of snakes that were hiding. 82 - 3 = 79 snakes were hiding.
