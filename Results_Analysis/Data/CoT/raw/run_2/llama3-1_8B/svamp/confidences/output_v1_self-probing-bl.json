If the bananas were divided into the same number of groups, each group would have to have 8 bananas. 8 bananas and 2 oranges make up 10 units of fruit. Since 178 oranges can make 356 units of fruit, each group of 10 fruit must make up 2 units. 8 bananas make 2 units, so Philip's 142 bananas are divided into 71 groups, each with 2 units of fruit.\n\n"}

How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?", "correct answer": 61.0, "llm answer": "61", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\n```Hint: The problem is an example of a word problem. You can try and solve it by assuming you are dealing with a number problem.```\n\nSolution: This is a pretty difficult problem to solve because it requires you to apply the concepts of statistics and calculus. I think the easiest way to solve it would be to first figure out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day. The number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day can be found by multiplying 600 (the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day) by 661 (the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day). Now, since we want to know how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day, we need to subtract 661 from 600. So, the answer to the problem is 39.\n\nIf the answer to the problem is 39, then it is correct to state that \"39 paintings\" are in the Buckingham palace. However, if the answer to the problem is 61, then it is incorrect to state that \"39 paintings\" are in the Buckingham palace.\n\nComment: I believe the solution is correct.\nAnswer: 61\nConfidence: 70%"}

How many minutes did the machine work today?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "9", "confidence": 0.15, "probing response": "15%\n\nExplanation:\nSince each question has only one correct answer and the machine made different number of shirts yesterday and today, the correct answer should have same or smaller number of shirts made today than yesterday. Therefore, we can eliminate any number larger than 8 from consideration, leaving only 3 possible answers. Then, we can reason about the likelihood of each of the 3 remaining answers by thinking about how well our reasoning applies to each one of them. Answer 9 is the most extreme answer. This is not a very likely answer because it means that the machine has been working for 4.5 minutes, and it can only make one shirt per minute.

For example, if you have a coin with 2 faces, and you flip it 10 times, the probability of getting exactly 5 heads is $2^{10}=1024$ which is not close to 50%.\nThe probability of getting 10 heads is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^{10}} = \\frac{1}{1024} = 0.0009766$ which is close to 0%.\n\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Assume students could solve the problem by many different methods. For each student, they may choose different methods to answer and may or may not show their reasoning clearly. Your design needs to take all these possibilities into account. How should you design a correct answer check list?\n\nA: I believe that answer check lists should be designed to be as broad as possible. Rather than giving the answer as 858, it would be better to list a range of answers such as 856-860 or a formula that the student could use to find the answer such as x = (26 x 33) + 1. In this way, the student will have to show their work in order to earn a full score.\n\nQ: What if you have to design the question? How would you design the question?\n\nA: I would design the question to be more open-ended.

This way, the student would have to think critically about the problem and be able to explain their thought process.\n\nQ: Now think of an effective way to check the student's answer"}

First, we will divide the candies into 2 groups, Group 1 and Group 2.\n2. We will then assign one of the two groups as Group 1 and the other as Group 2. The number of candies in each group will be 42/2 = 21.\n3.

Here's why:\nWhen we divide 42 pieces of candy into 2 groups equally, each group will have 21 pieces of candy. The probability of any given piece of candy being in either group is 1/2, since there are two possible groups. Therefore, the probability of 21 pieces of candy being in one group is also 1/2.\nSince there is only one possible outcome (21 pieces of candy in one group), the probability of this outcome"}

Because this problem requires mathematical knowledge, we need to write it out mathematically. First, let's denote the number of roses as R and the number of orchids as O. Let the total number of roses and orchids cut as C. We have the equation:\n`R + C = 10`\nAnd also\n`O + C = 21`\nTherefore, the number of orchids cut can be calculated as follows:\n`O + C = 21`\n`21 - O = C`\nSo the number of orchids cut is 21-O.\nNow let's consider the answer choice, answer 19: \n`21 - O = 19`\nSo, `O = 2`. We can only obtain this value if O is equal to 2. Therefore, answer 19 is correct and has a 100% chance of being correct.\n```"}

What is the answer? Please write the numerical value with no decimal places, e.g., \"71\" not \"71.0\"\n41\n\nExplanation: The following is a typical problem in statistics. Suppose that a baker made 144 cakes in total, and that 71 of them were sold, then he made 111 more cakes, the probability distribution of the total number of cakes sold is a binomial distribution with parameters 144 and 71/144.\nConfidence 89% is given by the following formula: Confidence = 1 - 2*0.5*0.5 = 0.75. The 0.5 is the result of dividing by 144 (the number of trials) in the binomial distribution."}

But from my limited understanding, I guess 99 bananas, 9 eggs, and 27 marbles are just for demonstration purposes? And Rebecca is supposed to split the collection of eggs only? So the total number of groups created should be 99 bananas divided by 3 eggs which is about 33. I think this answer is the most logical because Rebecca only has 99 bananas and 9 eggs. But there are 27 marbles, which may or may not be relevant. I'm not sure if the total number of groups"}

How many boys did she give the marbles to?", "correct answer": 14.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.1, "probing response": "10%\nExplanation: For this problem I will do some algebra to simplify it. Let's say we have 7 marbles (in Haley's hand) and the boys are playing a game. The probability of having 1 boy love to play marbles is 1/7. This means that in a game 6 out of 7 boys will not love to play marbles. \nNext, let's say we have 14 marbles (again, in Haley's hand) and the boys are playing a game. The probability of having 1 boy love to play marbles is 1/14. This means that in a game 13 out of 14 boys will not love to play marbles. \nSince we are using the same numbers (marbles and boys) we can say that for 7 marbles, 6 boys love to play marbles. And for 14 marbles, 13 boys love to play marbles. We know that for 28 marbles (in Haley's hand), there are 27 boys playing marbles, but we don't know how many of those 27 boys actually love to play marbles. We can find this out by multiplying 7 by 2 (since each boy has 2"}

We can find that the probability of 2 planks to be correct is 100% by using the formula. 100%*0.5*0.5=100%. (The first 0.5 is for nail is a whole, the second one is for each plank has 2 nails, which means the answer should be divisible by 2, and this is a multiple choice question, so the answer should be only one of the options.)\n\n\nAnswer: (2 planks).

An arrow points from 253 to 183. A second arrow points from 253 to 182. The second arrow is longer than the first arrow, which means the probability of 183 being the correct answer is larger than the probability of 182 being correct.\n\nFirst, we need to write the probability that the correct answer is 183 and the probability that the correct answer is 182 in equation form.

First find the price of one pack of cookie and one pack of cake.\n2. Then find the total amount of money Lucy paid.\n3. The amount of money she has after paying is the amount she paid, minus the total price of the items she bought.\n4. In this case, the total price of the items she bought must be equal to the amount of money she had in the end.\n\nExplanation:\nThe answer 0.85 is obtained as follows.\n1. First, find the price of 1 pack of cookie and 1 pack of cake.\n2. Since the amount of money Lucy had in the end is 56, Lucy must have paid a total amount of 56.\n3. So the answer is 56 divided by the price of 1 pack of cookie and 1 pack of cake.\n\nSolution:\nThe price of 1 pack of cookie and 1 pack of cake is 12+3=15.\nThe price of 56 is 56/15.\nTherefore, the number of packs of groceries is 56/15.\n"}

{"question": "Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven who has 13 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 19 peaches. How many peaches does Jill have?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\n# My Answer\n\nI think this question is not difficult and doesn’t need to use any algorithm, but just do some thinking about the information that are given. We can list all three persons with different peaches number. Let’s say, peaches that Steven has is S, peaches that Jake has is J, and peaches that Jill has is J. We are told that Steven has 19 peaches, that means $$S = 19$$. With the given information that Jake has 18 fewer than Steven, so Jake has $$J = S - 18 = 19 - 18 = 1$$. We also know that Steven has 13 more than Jill, so Jill has $$J = S - 13 = 19 - 13 = 6$$. \n\nThe answer is Jill has 6 peaches. \n\n# What I learned\n\nThis question seems very easy and only needs some thinking, and it doesn’t need to use any algorithm.

(please show your reasoning concisely)\n```Answer: [the best answer to be correct, please only include the numerical number]```\nAnswer: 1884\n\n## Answer\nAnswer: 1884\n\n## Proof\nWe know that 1 sack contains 28 oranges. So, the amount of oranges in the total amount of sacks is the product of 28 and the amount of sacks. Therefore, the total amount of oranges per day is the product of 28 and 66. By multiplying them we get the total number of oranges harvested per day which is 1848. We also know that the number of oranges that they pick per day is an integer. We use this fact to make a guess of a number that is a little larger than 1848. We have guessed that the correct number is 1884 and therefore we believe that the best answer is 1884.\n\n## Error analysis\nWe did not use all the information we had to figure out the answer. We did not include the number of days in the year in our calculation. The number of days in the year is 365 which would make the total amount of oranges 1848 * 365 = 675660.\n"}

How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?", "correct answer": 70.0, "llm answer": "141 er", "confidence": 0.804, "probing response": "80.4%\n\nSolution: If I take 10,000 random guesses, there is about an 80.4% chance I will guess that he had 141 erasers left. But in practice, you don't have 10,000 guesses. You only have one. Therefore the question is whether the answer 141 er is more or less likely to be correct than some randomly selected alternative.\nThe number of possible correct answers is 201 (the total of 601 plus 406 minus 336). There are 101 different values for the total number of items. If there is no information in the question on the relative number of crayons and erasers, you might suppose that all 101 are equally likely (see note 1 below). Then the probability of 141 er is 141/201 = 70.1%. If you don't know much about the number of crayons and erasers, this is not much more likely than a random guess.\nThe question does tell us that the number of crayons is 201 (which is the same as 336) minus the number of erasers. The only possible values for the number of crayons are 336, 536, 736, 936 and 1136. There"}

It looks as though she's mixed up the amount of sugar and the amount of flour in her head, and that's why she's put in 11 cups of flour instead of 4. It's also true that she needs 1 2/3 cups more sugar than flour, because she only needs 5 cups of sugar and she has 3 1/3 cups left.\n\nI am pretty confident that the answer is correct, as it follows from basic math and logic.\n\nI'm fairly confident that the answer is correct because the amount of sugar and the amount of flour are given in the problem, and the question asks how many more cups of sugar she needs to add. The solution is to subtract 5 cups from 11 cups and get 6 cups, which is the amount of sugar she needs to add. I'm confident because I used the given information and the problem's instructions to figure out the answer, and there are no other factors that would affect the answer.\n\nI'm very confident that the answer is correct. It's very clear that Mary needs to add more sugar than flour in order to make a cake, and the amount of sugar needed is given as 5 cups"}

You should not answer with yes or no, but a more detailed answer is preferred, such as the reason why you think it's wrong or right. If the answer is wrong, it will be helpful if you suggest a correct answer and explain why.\n\nExplanation:\n\nInitially, Nell had 301 + 154 = 455 baseball cards. She gave 301 cards to Jeff and is now left with 154 cards, which is 455 - 301 = 154 cards.\n\nThe equation that represents this situation is N = 301 + 154, where N is the number of cards Nell had initially. Therefore, Nell had 301 + 154 = 455 baseball cards initially.\n\nSo, we can also answer this question using the formula for addition of two numbers.\n\nLet, Nell had x baseball cards initially. According to the given data, we can write,\n\nx - 301 = 154\n\nx = 154 + 301\n\nx = 455\n\nThus, Nell had 455 baseball cards initially."}

We only need the number of drums for grapes per day, the number of days, and the number of drums for grapes.\n\nDays | Drums per day | Drums\n---- | ------------- | -----\n77   | 221           |?  \n\nWe can compute the number of drums in 77 days by multiplying the number of days times the number of drums per day.

But he got 99 new customers, which makes the total 102. So, 102 customers were there at the end.\n\nI think the best way to think about the problem is that the waiter has to figure out how many people walked in after his original 8, since he can't tell how many people walked out (some people probably left while others came in, so it doesn't help to know that there are 102 people at the end).\n\nIt might help to think about it in terms of a situation where no one leaves at all (so that the problem gets easier). Imagine that 8 people walked in and 8 more walk in (99 people total), so there would be 16 people left. The number of people who walk in must be 99, since the waiter can't tell how many people walked in or walked out (so 99 people is the only thing he can say).\n\nSo, there are 102 people at the end because the number of people who walk in must be 99.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nSolution by a student\nI'll explain the steps needed to solve the question.\n\n1."}

We know he has 77 animals, which means the number of aquariums he has must be equal to the number of animals in each aquarium, 19, which is equal to 77/19=4.05 aquariums (it cannot be 4 aquariums since each aquarium only has 19 animals and he has 77 animals in total). So he has 4 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals.\n\nNow that we know he has 4 aquariums for saltwater animals and 62 aquariums for freshwater animals. In each aquarium, there are 19 animals. Therefore, he has 76 animals (4+62=66 aquariums, 19 animals in each aquarium, so 66*19= 1256 animals in total). This answer is incorrect.\n\nWe need to find the average number of animals per aquarium, which is equal to 77/66=1.17. Then, since there are 19 animals in each aquarium, we divide 19 by 1.17 to find the number of aquariums: 19/1.17=16."}

So, if we remove two items from the original 18 bananas, there should be 16 bananas left. So, the answer should be 8. But, because each item has a chance of 0.5 to be in the removed group, the total probability of the two items to be in the removed group is the square of 0.5, which is 0.25. So, if we remove two items from the original 18 bananas, there are 18-2-0.25*18=16.5 bananas left. So, the answer should be 8.5 groups left. But, again, each item has a chance of 0.5 to be in the removed group, the total probability of the two items to be in the removed group is the square of 0.5, which is 0.25.

From the text we know that $x - y = z$. Olivia spent 38 dollars, hence $y = 38$. Hence we are left with the following equation, $x - 38 = z$, where we need to find the value of $z$. Since we know the initial value of $x$, we can plug in the initial amount $128$ and solve the equation. Hence $z = 128 - 38 = 90$, so $90$ dollars is the amount of money she has left.\n"}

Each book costs x/92 dollars. Since he buys 92 books, the total cost of all the books should be 92x/92 = x. Thus, he starts with x dollars and has 6 dollars remaining at the end of his shopping trip. That is, he has x-6 dollars after he spent all of his money on books. Let's set up the equations: x-6 = 92x/92 --> x = 6 x-16 = 92x/92 --> x = 5.8 x - 6 = 92x/92 --> x = 5.88 This is the best option.\n\nExplanation: Edward started with x dollars. Each book costs x/92 dollars. The total cost of 92 books is 92x/92 = x dollars. So the money Edward starts with equals the money he ends with. Let's start by setting up the equation x - 16 = 92x/92.

So it will take 2 hours and 12 minutes to get to the bottom.\nIn two hours, they will travel 2*60*17 or 12,800 feet. So, 1218-12,800= 11,582.\nThen, they have 1182 feet left. To do this in 12 minutes, they must travel 1182/12 or 98.5 feet per minute.\nThe number of feet they will travel in 12 minutes will be 17 feet per minute * 12 minutes, or 204 feet.\nSo, the remaining distance is 1182 - 204 = 978 feet.\nSo, they must travel 978 feet in 12 minutes.\nTheir speed must be 978/12, or 81.5 feet per minute.\nTherefore, their speed is 17.5 feet per minute.

{"question": "The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "$ 37650", "confidence": 0.25, "probing response": "25%\n```Explanation:```The profit on shirts is $ 210 + $ 30, or $ 240. The profit on jerseys is $ 210 - $ 30, or $ 180. The net profit is the number of shirts sold multiplied by $ 30, plus the number of jerseys sold multiplied by $ 180, or $ 360 - $ 4200, or $ 37650. There are more factors than just the price difference, though. One is that the ratio of shirt to jersey sales is not 7.5 to 1, as assumed by a \"simple\" profit difference calculation, but 7.5 to 1.15, or 6.5 to 1. There is also the additional factor of the total amount of jerseys sold, which is 177.\nI feel it is safe to say that the answer is probably correct, but there is a possibility it is wrong. This may be because the questioner is just guessing, or because they are taking the above into account, or because I have made an error.\n```Reference:```https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3942743/1045769\n\nQ: Which of the following statements are correct?\n```[ ]```The answer"}

Then the money spent by Dan buying the chocolate bar will be y, which will be equal to 4 - x. We are given that x + y = 4 - x + x = 4, which means x + x = 4 and 2x = 4.

How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?", "correct answer": 30.0, "llm answer": "30", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, you can use the information given in the problem and the number of drums of grapes to be filled to calculate the number of days it will take to fill the drums.\nThe problem states that each of the 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. Therefore, each day, 36x8=288 drums of grapes will be filled. The problem also states that a total of 240 drums need to be filled. So, to solve for the number of days it will take to fill the drums, you can use the formula:\nNumber of days = Total number of drums filled / Number of drums filled per day\nTherefore, Number of days = 240 drums / 288 drums per day\nNumber of days = 0.8333 days\nSo, it will take about 30 days to fill the drums."}

{"question": "Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?", "correct answer": 44.0, "llm answer": "4 chapters", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\nExplanation: Let x be the number of chapters per day. We are looking for x.\nWe are told that x * 660 days = 15 chapters * 193 pages/chapter.\nSo, x = (15 chapters * 193 pages/chapter) / (660 days).\nTherefore, x = 45/22 ≈ 2 chapters.\nLet's see if 2 chapters per day is possible.\nFrank should finish reading 15 * 193 pages in 660 days.\nIf he read 2 chapters per day, he should finish 15 * 2 = 30 chapters in 660 days.\nIn this case, he should finish 193 * 30 pages in 660 days. The average number of pages per day should be 193 * 30 / 660 ≈ 9 pages per day.\nThis means Frank should read at least 9 pages a day, which is possible since each page is no longer than a chapter. Therefore, 2 chapters per day is possible. We just found the lower bound.\nThe upper bound of the possible number of chapters per day is 3, which is not possible.\nSo, the answer is 2 chapters per day, which is equivalent to 45/22 ≈ 2 chapters.\n\n"}

In many cases, we can reason with a degree of certainty and quantify this degree. As an example, consider the following question.\nQ: How many times will it rain tomorrow in Tokyo?\nA: I cannot know for certain, but I can guess that the chance is 1 in 7.\nIn the above example, the model we choose for the chance is the discrete uniform distribution. However, other models could also be used. For instance, we might know that on average, it rains on 1 in 5 days in the winter in Tokyo, and we could use this as a starting point to create a model.\n\nThere are a number of advantages to using this approach in decision making.\n    - The approach forces us to consider different possible outcomes and the relative likelihoods of each outcome occurring. By considering the different possible outcomes and the relative likelihoods of each outcome occurring, we can make more informed decisions.\n    - The approach also allows us to consider the impact of different possible outcomes on our decision.

The answer to a mathematical question is not \"100%\"! If you cannot understand that probability is not 100%, then you do not understand what a probability is, and should not be attempting these problems.\n\nIn a typical statistics class, students work with a data set of 150, or a set of dice with 36 possible outcomes, etc. A statistician knows that the data are finite, and therefore, that all probabilities are less than 100%.\n\nThis problem could be solved by finding the ratio of the unknown number to the known numbers, and multiplying by 100. That would be a correct approach, as well as the \"100%\" answer.\n\nThis is also a problem in math education, because a good answer is not necessarily a correct answer. In math education, the emphasis is on understanding, so that students can correctly reason about and with numbers. In real life, you will not be expected to know how to calculate the probability."}

This could be done by adding the marbles Doug lost to the marbles he started with and then subtracting the marbles he gained. Since Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, we can set up the following equation: $$24 + \\text{# of marbles Doug had at start} = \\text{# of marbles Doug had after losing}$$\nThe only way we can know what this equation equals is if we know the number of marbles Doug started with.

Since Matthew is giving the same number of crackers and cakes, we know that each friend receives the same number of crackers and cakes. This means that the total number of crackers and cakes must be divisible by 4.\n\nLet’s start by writing an equation for the number of crackers each friend receives. We know that Matthew has 32 crackers and gives out the same number of crackers to each friend, so we can write the following equation:\n\n4(x) = 32\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, each friend receives 8 crackers.\n\nNow, let’s consider the number of cakes each friend receives. We know that Matthew has 98 cakes and gives out the same number of cakes to each friend, so we can write the following equation:\n\n4(y) = 98\ny = 24.5\n\nHowever, since we cannot have half a cake, we know that each friend receives 24 cakes.\n\nTherefore, each friend receives 8 crackers and 24 cakes.\n\nThe answer is 8 crackers and 24 cakes.\n\nQ: What does this question actually asks for?\n```What does this question actually asks for?```\nWhat does this question actually asks for?\n"}

First, for each plank, it needs 3 nails. Thus, in order to have an additional 8 nails, there must be 8/(3*3) = 13/9 = 1.44 planks. Since we have the fraction, we can either round it to the next bigger integer, or say it's not exactly 1.4 planks, which makes 3 as an incorrect answer. \nSo, the answer is most likely to be 4.\nQ: How likely is the above answer to be correct?

In this case, we are calculating the error between the answer and the length of Robin's hair. We know that the actual result is the length of Robin's hair, which is 14 inches. So, the absolute error is calculated as the difference between 14 inches and the answer.\nThe answer in the question is 1 inch of hair. We need to calculate the absolute error between 1 inch of hair and 14 inches. The difference is 13 inches, which means that the absolute error is 13 inches.\nWe then compare this absolute error with the actual length of Robin's hair, which is 14 inches. The absolute error is 13 inches, which is more than half of the actual length. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer 1 inch of hair is unlikely to be correct.\nWe need to find the confidence level. We can do this by calculating the probability that the answer is correct, given the absolute error. We can use the formula for probability, which is P(event) = (# of favorable outcomes)/(total # of possible outcomes).\nIn this case, the favorable outcome is that the"}

How many chairs are there for each table?", "correct answer": 6.0, "llm answer": "6 chairs", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nSolution: The question states that they have 2 sets of tables and the number of chairs in each set is same. So, we have to split 12 chairs in 2 equal sets. We know that 6 is a factor of 12. So, we can split 12 chairs in 2 equal sets with 6 chairs in each set. Hence, the answer is 6 chairs. We can write the probability of answer to be correct as, Probability of answer 6 chairs to be correct = Number of ways to split 12 chairs in 2 equal sets with 6 chairs in each set / Total number of ways to split 12 chairs in 2 equal sets = 2!/2! * (12/6) = 1/2 * 2 = 1/1 = 100%. We can see that this probability is 100%. Hence, we are 100% confident that answer is 6 chairs. Confidence of 100% means, there is no other way of splitting the chairs than the given way. We could have written the probability as 100% or 1, which is same thing. We can write the probability of answer to be incorrect as, Probability of answer 6 chairs to be incorrect"}

How much money will have at the end of the harvest season?", "correct answer": 3834.0, "llm answer": "$ 3834", "confidence": 0.75, "probing response": "75%\n\nExplanation:\nTo work out the solution, we use algebra and arithmetic. I assume that Lewis has to pay $ 702 tax to the government after 216 weeks of working. To work out how much money Lewis has left, we can use the formula: total money earned - tax paid = money left. The problem wants to find how much money Lewis has left after 216 weeks of working, which is the total money earned, which I will represent as $T, and $ 702 is the amount of tax paid. I then represent $ 21 as $e because that is how much Lewis earns every week. $T = $e x 216 - $ 702 I now use algebra to rearrange the equation so that $T is on its own. 216e - $ 702 = $T 216e = $ 702 + $T e = ($ 702 + $T)/216 I have found the amount that Lewis earns every week, which is $e, to be ($ 702 + $T)/216. To work out how much money Lewis has after 216 weeks of working, I need to multiply $e by 216. The solution is therefore: $e x 216 ($ 702 + $T)/"}

If we can find the average of the data, then we can easily find out the number of visitors within the last 89 days. However, there is no easy way to calculate the average of the data. So, here I will give you a more straightforward solution. It is a simple trick.\nThe first two numbers, 512, 471, are obviously data of consecutive days. However, the first number, 512, is obviously an outlier since it is quite larger than the other numbers. To solve this problem, we can easily remove the outlier. And the average of the new data would be\n$$\\frac{471+808}{2} = 639.5$$\nThen the number of visitors within the last 89 days would be $$639.5\\times89 = 56832.5$$\n\nQ: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?", "correct answer": 6264.0, "llm answer": "135 drums", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nExplanation: It is not given that 57 and 252 are the number of stops and pickers each day.\nAssuming it is the case that there is one stop per day and 252 pickers on each day, then it is likely that the vineyard is a 9-acre patch divided into 9 1-acre patches. One can pick 108 5-gallon drums of grapes from 1 acre of grapevine per day. The farmer can fill 108 drums from each 1-acre patch in 1 day, so there would be 1080 drums from 9 acres of grapevine on each day. Thus, in 58 days, there would be 63,600 drums (1080 x 58)."}

Each block contains 19 houses, and the mailman delivers the same number of pieces of junk mail to each house in each block. Therefore, the mailman gives 38 * 19 = 722 pieces of junk mail to each block.\nIn the second scenario, the mailman gives 38 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks, but there are 19 houses on each block. This means that the mailman delivers 38 pieces of junk mail to each house, regardless of which block it is in. Therefore, the answer to the question is 38.\n```"}

With a multiplication problem, you always ask how many times you can use the bottom number to reach the top number. For instance, with 5 marbles and 3 boys, you can get to 15 marbles by using the 5 marbles three times. To solve this problem, you just need to use the reverse of the multiplication problem. With 5 boys and 10 marbles, you can get to 50 marbles by using the 10 marbles five times. Thus, the answer is five groups of 5 marbles in 10 total marbles. Five boys were given the marbles. "}

{"question": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.97, "probing response": "97%\n\nExplanation:\nFrom Paige's statement, we have\n- $n = 36$\n- $x = 12$\n- $p = 58/12$\nThen $np = 36 * 58/12 = 186$, $nq = 36 * (1-58/12) = 6$, so $np > 5$ and $nq > 5$.\nSo from Poisson's approximation, the expected number of flower beds $p_0 = np$ and the variance is $npq$.\nThen we have\n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\nP(X = 3) &=& e^{-p_0} * {p_0^3}/{3!}\\\\\n&=& e^{-186} * {186^3}/{6}\\\\\n&\\approx& 0.0007 \\end{eqnarray}$$\nThis is the least likely scenario. The most likely one is to have 2 flower beds, with the probability of $P(X = 2) = e^{-186} * {186^2}/{2} \\approx 0.07$.\n\nQ: If Paige had planted the same number of seeds into 2 flower beds, how many flower"}

{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.5, "probing response": "50%\n\nQ: Are there other possible answers that are correct? If yes, which one(s)? If no, how do you know? \nNo, because if she puts 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour, the ratio between sugar and flour is 1:2. If she put 4 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour, the ratio between sugar and flour is 2:5, which is not a ratio of 1:2, the sugar:flour ratio is wrong.\n\nQ: How does your reasoning work for this problem? (You may give a formal account or informal account, but please provide a clear and coherent explanation.)\nI think I get it. If she already put 4 cups of sugar in, then she can not add 3 cups of sugar because the recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar. So, she can only add 3 more cups of sugar. Otherwise, the sugar:flour ratio will be 4:10 or 2:5 which is not what the recipe calls for.\n"}
