Paco ate 9 salty cookies and had 17 left. There are a total of 35 cookies, so if Paco ate 14 of the 35, that means he had 21 left.

We can consider birds to be variable. We can consider variable to be constant or change by a change rule. A change rule will include the unit of change. For example, 3 more birds can also mean 3 more chickens, or 3 more dogs. 6 more storks and 2 more birds are 6 more storks and 2 more birds of the same type of birds. We can then count birds as a sum of two groups, 9 storks and 3 birds, 9 + 3. We can count storks and birds as two groups, the total number of birds minus the number of storks. Since there are 3 more birds than storks, we count it as the total number of birds minus 3. We can count storks as the number of storks, and count birds as"}

Since there are 458 more girls than boys (B), there are 692 - 458 = 234 more boys than girls (C). Then we have the total number of boys (D), that is 234 + 692 = 926. (D) is equal to the sum of (A) and (B). (A) and (C) are both equal to (B) in opposite signs, so the sum of (A) and (C) should be zero. In the question, the total number of boys and girls (E) = 926 + 692 = 1618. Then we have the sum of (A) and (C) = 692 + 234 = 926.

We need to calculate the number of movies the narrator has read more than the books.\nGiven: Number of books: 8; Number of movies: 5; Read books: 19; Watched books: 16.\nTo solve the above problem, we need to subtract the number of watched books from the number of read movies.\n19 - 16 = 3.\nTherefore, the narrator has read 3 movies more than the books.\nSo, the correct option is 3.\nThe keywords ‘16 books’, ‘19 movies’ and ‘3’ helps us to solve the problem.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 3."}

{"question": "Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nThe first thing we can do is look at our keywords to see if they can help us deduce the answer. First, looking at the first sentence, we can see that Danny found 46 wrappers at the park. The second sentence tells us that Danny has a total of 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. It is very likely that Danny collected 1 more wrapper than bottle caps, or in other words, Danny has 21 bottle caps in his collection. If we deduct 1 wrapper from Danny's collection, we can get the total number of wrappers Danny collected at the park. 52 - 1 = 51 wrappers. Therefore, Danny collected 1 more wrapper than bottle caps at the park. The answer is 4. We can verify the answer by deducting 4 wrappers from Danny's collection. 52 - 4 = 48 wrappers, and 50 bottle caps."}

How far did the mouse jump?", "correct answer": 39.0, "llm answer": "63 inches", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nReasoning: The frog jumped 3 more than the grasshopper, hence 9+3=12 inches. The mouse jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, hence 33+12=45 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog, hence 45-3=42 inches. The sum of the frog’s and the mouse’s jump should be 63, and it is 63 (42+33=75-3=42). The possible answer is 63 inches and it is correct. Therefore, the answer is 95%.\nQ: You are given 10 minutes to think about and come up with the possible answer to this question: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest.

{"question": "Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gym class today. David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than zachary. How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?", "correct answer": 32.0, "llm answer": "145", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nReasoning: The question asks how many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do, not how many more push-ups did Zachary do. The question specifically asks about the difference in Zachary's push-ups and crunches. Since there are 87 more crunches than push-ups, it is possible to have 87 more crunches than push-ups or 87 less crunches than push-ups. Both scenarios are consistent with the question, so I don't know which is correct. In addition, the question does not ask for a specific number, only a difference. Therefore, there is no correct answer to the question. If the question asked for the number of push-ups that Zachary did, I would be more confident in selecting the possible answer."}

How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\n\nReasoning: As we know, the question requires us to figure out how many more cookies Paco ate than he gave to his friend, we can think of the problem as how many cookies he ate more. So the subtraction should be the reverse, and we are going to have \"gave\" in the numerator. Besides, to compare cookies Paco ate with those he gave, we can also reverse the question and compare the difference of the amount of cookies with each friend. Then the answer is 1 because Paco ate 1 more cookie than he gave to his friend. Therefore, we can be 80% confident that the answer is correct."}

For example, 19 + 18 = 37, 38 - 37 = 1. I could be wrong though. But for the same number of tag kids on monday and tuesday, she can do this 38 - 38 = 0, 38 - 37 = 1.

How many pages did he read per day?", "correct answer": 7.0, "llm answer": "112", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\nReasoning:\n```We can conclude from the information above that the number of pages read per day is between 6 and 7. This is because the number of pages in the book is 112, and the number of days it took to read the book is 16. If the number of pages read per day was between 7 and 8, the number of days it would have taken to read the book would be between 14 and 15. So, 7 is the minimum number of pages read per day and 8 is the maximum number of pages read per day.\nTherefore, the correct answer must be one of the following:\n6, 7 or 8\nHowever, the answer cannot be 6 or 8, because we know from the information that the number of pages read per day is between 6 and 7. Therefore, the only possible answer is 7.\nAs we can see from the keyword reasoning, there are a total of 16 days in the book. If the book has 112 pages, that means that the author has written 7 pages per day on average. Therefore, the answer must be between 6 and 7.\nThe answer 7 is most likely to be correct because it is"}

Then, since there are 8 digits, the number of kids going to camp is 9*9+8 = 9*8 + 9 = 73 + 9 = 82. The number of kids staying home is 82 + 8285 - 80059 = 8285 + 8285 - 80059 = 8285 + 28262 = 106247.

So we can tell that there are 7 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking. 160 - 7 = 153. 153 - 41 = 112. So we can also tell that after yesterday's picking, there are 112 tomatoes. Since there are 112 tomatoes after yesterday's picking and there are 7 tomatoes left after yesterday's picking, we know that there are 7 + 112 = 119 tomatoes after today's picking. If the answer was 63, there would be 63 - 41 = 22 tomatoes after today's picking. However, we know that there are 119 tomatoes after today's picking, which is more than 22.

{"question": "Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 479 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while 489 suggested adding bacon to the menu. How many more students suggested bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes?", "correct answer": 10.0, "llm answer": "10", "confidence": 0.35, "probing response": "35%\nExplanation: The wording of this problem is confusing. Since bacon is added, there will be 479 + 489 = 968 new suggestions for the menu and the number of people who suggested bacon is larger. It is therefore impossible to say how many more people suggested bacon than mashed potatoes. However, this question has been asked on the GRE for 6 years and the only possible answer is 10. This answer can also be confirmed by looking at how many students didn't suggest anything. It is 3 - 489 = 477 people. Since the total number of students is 1000, and 10% more suggested bacon, we can say that 1000 * 0.1 + 477 = 487 people suggested bacon. The difference between the people who suggested bacon and mashed potatoes is therefore 489 - 487 = 2, which is 10% of 2.

Since Mary only wants to put 14 cups of flour. So she still needs 7 cups more to add.\n@Yiwen, I think that this question was a poorly written question. But if she already has 7 cups of flour in it then she should have 14 more cups to finish her cake, so she has 7 more cups of flour to add to her cake. So I would have to say it's 7 more cups of flour to add to her cake.\n@Yiwen, I think it's 7. So far, she has used 7 cups of flour and 14 cups are left. She will need to use 7 more cups of flour for her cake.\nI agree with 7"}

If we consider 45 as the initial total number of families, we can deduct 41 families as they flew away. Now, to find the number of families that stayed behind, we subtract 41 from 45 to get 4, which is the answer. However, it is not given whether this is the correct answer. Thus, we consider the keywords and see if they provide any additional information. We see that the keywords state that most animals flew away. Thus, we assume that a majority of the families flew away. This suggests that only a small number of families stayed behind, which is contrary to the calculation we performed earlier. Therefore, we conclude that the possible answer 41 cannot be correct. Now, we consider answer 46. If we assume that all the families flew away, then the initial total should be 45 families.

How many pupils are there in that school?", "correct answer": 1542.0, "llm answer": "1542", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning to the possible answer: The question is actually asking for a formula to solve the number of pupils in that school, based on the given information. So we can simply use the formula n(A) = n(A\\cup B) - n(B) to get the number of pupils. In this question, there are 700 girls and the rest are boys, which can be written as the union of 700 girls (denoted as A) and n(B) boys (denoted as B). Since there are 142 more boys than girls, we have n(B) = 700 + 142 = 842. So the number of pupils is: n(A\\cup B) - n(B) = 700 + 842 - 842 = 700. Thus, the total number of pupils in that school is 700.\nThe key idea behind the above reasoning is that we use the formula n(A) = n(A\\cup B) - n(B) to find the number of pupils in the school. We first determine the number of pupils in the union of girls and boys, which is 700 + 142 = 842. Then we subtract the number of boys, which is 700 + 142 = 842,"}

Now we need to subtract these two values to find the fourth digit of the difference. To subtract these two values we need to borrow from the previous column, and that is the only place to borrow from. 840-0 = 840 and 1-0 = 1. Thus the fourth digit of the difference is 40.

Because we only have $3, that means $3 minus the cost of the candy bars is $0. Thus, we get: 2x = $4 2x − 2x = $4 − 2x $4 − 2x = $0 2x = $4 x = $2\".\n– Daniel R. Collins\n@Daniel"}

Please first show your reasoning concisely and then answer with the following format:\n```Confidence: [the probability of your answer to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```\nConfidence: 20%\nExplanation: I will explain my reasoning for answer 52. Emily has to make 26 necklaces. Each necklace has to have 2 beads. This means there has to be 52 beads, because if there were only 51, that would mean she would only be able to make 25 necklaces. However, since we know she made 26 necklaces, that means she must have had 52 beads."}

From 41 pounds, we subtracted 11 pounds, which is equal to the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries.\nAnswer: 19 pounds\nKeywords during reasoning to the answer: ['41 pounds', '11 pounds', '30 pounds', '19 pounds']\nReasoning: Marco and his dad together picked 41 pounds of strawberries. The weight of Marco's dad's strawberries is 11 pounds, and the weight of Marco's strawberries is 19 pounds. So together, they picked 11 + 19 = 30 pounds of strawberries."}

How many rows could she make?", "correct answer": 42.0, "llm answer": "42", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning:\nMy reasoning for thinking this to be correct is: Since the correct answer is 42, it means there are 16 rows, but there are actually 28 packs of pencils, so that means each pack is used 2 times. Since the number of pencils in each row is 16, it means the number of pencils in each pack is 16, so that means the number of pencils in each pack is 16*24. So, 16*24= 672, and since the 28 packs of pencils are all used 2 times, that means 28*2= 56 packs of pencils are used, so that means the 28 packs of pencils are used 56 times, so that means 672/56= 12, so that means there are 12 rows in each pack of pencils, so that means the number of rows is 28*12= 336, but since 12 is used 28 times, that means the number of rows is 28+336= 364, so that means 364-336= 28, so that means there are 28 rows, so that means the number of rows is 28.

The correct answer is actually 9. The problem statement said there were 3 storks sitting on the fence and 6 more storks came, so there are 3 + 6 = 9 storks sitting on the fence. The problem also said there were 4 birds sitting on the fence, so there are 4 birds and 9 storks sitting on the fence. So, there are 9 storks and 4 birds sitting on the fence, and the correct answer is 9 - 4 = 5. The answer is 5, not 9, because the problem statement said there were 3 storks sitting on the fence and 6 more storks came, so there are 3 + 6 = 9 storks sitting on the fence. The problem also said there were 4 birds sitting on the fence, so there are 4 birds and 9 storks sitting on the fence.

{"question": "Jessie weighed 114 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?", "correct answer": 4.0, "llm answer": "4", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\nThe first thing to note is that the answer choices are discrete, and they're given in kilograms. This means that the most likely answer choice will have a whole number. 114/50 = 2.28, and 114/60 = 1.9, both of which are close to the 1 in the answer choice. That makes the answer seem more likely. We also know that if we had to choose between 4 and 5, we would be forced to take 4. This is because we can take the weight loss of the previous week from 114 kilograms, and we would get 4. This shows that the weight loss was consistent. The answer seems to make sense, but there is one more thing that makes it seem even more likely. If we were to make 2 and 3 the possible answers, and there was no answer 4, we would choose 3. This is because we know that the weight loss was consistent and that we could just make 3 the correct answer. This tells us that if we are given an answer choice that is one smaller than the next answer, it is probably the correct answer. This is a great rule to follow when solving number riddles.

This is the number of days it will take to harvest the first 16 sacks. The problem tells us that each sack contains 57 oranges. This is the number of oranges in 16 sacks. The problem then asks for how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks. We know that there are 57 oranges per sack. Therefore, it takes one sack to harvest 57 oranges. To harvest 80 sacks, we will need 80 sacks * 57 oranges per sack, which equals 4560 oranges. 4560 oranges is 5 times 912 oranges. We need 5 days to harvest 16 sacks. We need 5 times 16 sacks (80 sacks) to harvest 4560 oranges. The answer is 1.404 days.\nQ: Considering these keywords as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be"}

We denote it as 'HairLength' (I used the same variable name as answer). Initially, 'HairLength' = 14. 'HairLength' grows by 8 inches. After this, we cut 20 inches from 'HairLength' so new length of 'HairLength' = initial length of 'HairLength' - cut off length = 14 - 20 = -6 inches.\nAfter some more information (keywords) we have 'HairLength' = -6, we can assume it means 'HairLength' is minus 6 inches, i.e. it is 6 inches shorter. Then, the correct answer should be 6 inches longer than 'HairLength', i.e. 6 + (-6) = 0, which is also minus 6 inches, so the correct answer should be 2 inches.\nExplanation for confidence score: I am not sure how can I answer this question correctly (100%) according to the above reasoning.

We need to reason that in order to distribute the eggs equally between 4 groups, we need to divide 8 by 4.

This reasoning is based on the assumption that we want to distribute the eggs as equally as possible between the 4 groups.\nNow, when we look at the possible answer of 3½, it contradicts the above reasoning. The reasoning suggests that we should distribute the eggs evenly between the 4 groups, resulting in each group having 2 eggs.

First there is a lack of detail, such as what exactly is camp, or even if \"camp\" is a singular or plural word. We can assume that \"go to camp\" means going to camp from home. Without any additional information, it is impossible to solve. However, we could guess a few numbers that satisfy the constraints (which are not very strong). One solution is that there are 2888 kids going to camp. 313473 – 274865 = 38408 kids staying home. 274865 + 2888 = 276753 kids going to camp (home or away).\nTo see that 2888 is the only solution in which every kid either stays home or goes to camp, we just need to see that 38408 and 276753 are relatively prime, so their least common multiple is their product. 38408 * 276753 = 1063640764 and is a positive integer.\nThis is a good exercise in number theory and finding relatively prime numbers.\nI don't know what confidence to assign this answer, but it seems like there should be a number other than 2888.

There is only one answer which meets this criteria.\n\nFor the second question, we can calculate the probabilities of the answers 91, 13 and 7. Since there is no answer given for 7, we can use the answer we thought was correct in the answer format.\n91 is 10/100 or 10%. This is because the probability of a correct answer given one integer is 1/4, and we have two incorrect answers and one correct one. 13 is 0/100 or 0%.

However, I think this question is related to \"fractions\", so I think it should be a fraction number. Then I think about the most basic operation in fractions, namely division. I know 9 is divisible by 2, but 10 is not divisible by 2. So I think I should do multiplication first. 9 times 2 is 18. Then I think about 18 and 10, 10 is divisible by 2. So 18 divided by 2 is 9. It is a number that is not divisible by 2, but 9 is divisible by 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3. So I think the answer should be 3. The answer is not 4.5.

We can divide the keywords into two sets. The first set is made of 629424, while the other set is 898051. Then, 898051 - 629424 = 268627. That's the number of kids who stay home.

I believe that the amount of roses left in the garden is a variable because the number of roses that are left in the garden will be different based on the amount that Jessica cuts from her garden.

(Give a detailed reasoning and show your steps to calculate)\nQ: The given answer is also correct.\nReasoning: The question tells us that the mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each block. Since there are 55 blocks, we can calculate that the total amount of junk mail is 55 x 32 = 1760. Now, we also know that the mailman gives 8 mails to each house in a block. This means that the total amount of junk mail given to the houses in each block is 8 x 2 = 16. To make sure we have all the information, we can now see that the amount of junk mail given to the houses in each block is 16 and the total amount of junk mail given to all blocks is 1760. Since the total amount of junk mail given to the houses in each block is 16, we know that the total amount of houses in a block is 1760 / 16 = 110. Therefore, the answer is 110."}

How many crayons did he get for his birthday?", "correct answer": 728.0, "llm answer": "176", "confidence": 0.65, "probing response": "65%\nExplanation: We assume there are 177 pieces of crayons that Paul got for his birthday. To keep track, we can start by putting the initial 177 pieces of crayons in a row (Figure 1). Paul gave away 51 pieces of crayons or took them out of the original 177 pieces of crayons. That means there are 177-51=126 pieces of crayons left (Figure 2). However, as we know, Paul gave away 51 pieces of crayons and then lost another 551 pieces of crayons. If he gave away 51 crayons out of 177, then he lost another 551 crayons out of 177-51=126. That means we need to take 126-551=126-551=125=55 more pieces of crayons out of the original 177 pieces of crayons (Figure 3). After taking the 55 crayons out, the total number of crayons left is 177-55=177-55=122 (Figure 4). This means the number of crayons Paul gave away or lost equals to 177-122=55 (Figure 5).

{"question": "The ring toss game at the carnival made 144 dollars per day. They were at the carnival for 22 days. How much money did they make?", "correct answer": 3168.0, "llm answer": "3,168", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\nReasoning:\n```The ring toss game is an activity that can be seen at carnivals. In this activity, participants are given a ring and must try to throw it onto a pole in order to win a prize. The more successful throws, the more money the participant can win. However, there are also several rules that must be followed in order to play the game. For example, participants must keep their hands above their heads at all times, and they must not touch the pole or any other object while throwing the ring.\nThe 144 dollars per day is likely a profit, rather than a total income, since the activity is designed to be profitable. Thus, the total income for 22 days should be a multiple of 144, and 3,168 dollars is a reasonable answer based on the provided information.\nIn conclusion, the above answer is likely to be correct, with a confidence level of 40%.\"```"}

That means Steven has 11 more peaches than Jake, so Steven has 17+11=28 peaches.\nConfidence: 30%\nExplanation of reasoning: I guess you get 8 peaches when you take 11 peaches away, so Steven should have 17+8=25 peaches, but you can't take 11 peaches away from 17 peaches, and get 8 peaches, so I think 25 is wrong.\nConfidence: 90%\nExplanation of reasoning: I don't really understand how the question is written, so I just do whatever I want to get 11 peaches.\nConfidence: 75%\nExplanation of reasoning: Jake has 8 peaches, and 8+11=19.

How big is each group of bananas?", "correct answer": 145.0, "llm answer": "Each group contains 0.", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100.0%\nExplanation: Given the additional information provided in the keywords, the best answer is definitely `Each group contains 0`. Since there are 93 groups of oranges and we are told that there are 0.936 oranges per group, we have 93*0.936 = 87.264 oranges. In other words, there is 0.264 oranges left. We are given 290 bananas. If we divide 290 by 0.264 we have 290/0.264 = 1099.23 bananas, which means there are 1099.23 bananas left after we have put 0 bananas into 93 groups.\nIn this reasoning process, we have assumed that 93 groups of bananas can hold the entire 290 bananas. To see whether this assumption holds, we check the sum of bananas in each group, which is equal to 0.936. So 93 groups of 0.936 bananas can hold 93*0.936 = 86.992 bananas. The 290 bananas do not fit in 93 groups of 0.936 bananas.\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Each group contains 0.\nWe can use the same reasoning to find out how many bananas can fit in 93"}

Therefore, the numerical value of ‘total earnings’ is $ 133, which means Lewis earns $ 133 in total. Next, I identified the last keyword, ‘7’. After identifying the keyword ‘7’, I realized that the keyword ‘7’ is a numerical value of a quantity that is mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the quantity ‘7’ is equal to $ 7, because $ 7 is a numerical value that is a part of the question. After identifying the quantity ‘7’ as $ 7, I compared the quantities to the answer given.

When the question was asked, the 2 possible answers were 2 tickets and 5 tickets, so the possible keywords are \"5 tickets\", \"2 tickets\". \"Dave had won 18 tickets\" is an interesting information but it didn't help with the counting process. \"If he used 5 to buy some toys and 11 more to buy some clothes\" is also an interesting information, but it just repeats some keywords in the possible answers. It didn't add to the reasoning process of counting. Finally, the keywords during the reasoning process to the answer are \"2 tickets\", \"5 tickets\", so we put the keywords together to form a complete question, and answered this complete question."}

Considering these keywords as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?\nThe above answer of 5 groups seems to be correct because the number of marbles, 20, divided by the number in a group, 4, results in 5. This suggests that 5 groups of marbles could be created.\nThe above answer of 5 groups does not seem to be correct because if Rebecca uses 5 eggs to create the 5 groups, each group will require 4 marbles. If 5 groups of 4 marbles each are created, the total number of marbles would be 20 marbles, which is not the number of marbles, 20, given in the original question.

A typical reasoning problem consists of a rule (e.g., \"subtracting cookies Paco had to give away to his friend\"), a task (e.g., \"How many cookies did Paco have left?\"), and a set of choices (e.g., 4, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30).\nThe above example is designed to be \"in the zone\", meaning the right answer is 12 because of the rule (subtracting the number Paco gave to his friend from the number he had). However, even \"in the zone\" problems can be very difficult. If Paco had 10 cookies, he had 6 cookies left. If Paco had 20 cookies, he had 14 cookies left. And so on. Even if the task is \"easy\", the reasoning required can be hard.\nWe are interested in measuring two aspects of reasoning problems.\n"}

{"question": "After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet. How deep was the water?", "correct answer": 208.0, "llm answer": "9.45", "confidence": 0.0, "probing response": "0%\n```Reasoning:\nIf the water is 9 feet deep and Ron is 9 feet taller than Dean then Dean is 18 feet tall and so the water is 27 feet deep. But the water is 16 times as deep as Ron is tall so the water is 144 feet deep not 27 feet deep. So there is an error in the statement: \"Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron.\"\nIf the water is 22 feet deep then Dean is 14 times Ron's height. The height of the water is the product of Ron's height and the number of times Ron's height the water is. So Ron must be 13/14 feet tall for the water to be 22 feet deep. So Ron is 9.45 feet tall, Dean is 18.9 feet tall, and the water is 22 feet deep.\nSo 9.45 feet is the only possible answer.\nThe question gives no information about the water's depth and it doesn't give the difference in heights between Dean and Ron. So there isn't enough information to solve the problem. The keywords don't give any more information either.\n```Reasoning: \nI think Ron's height is 9 feet and Dean's height is 18 feet"}

To make my calculations simple, I will assume that the farmer was picking from 53 identical tomatoes and the probability of getting any one of them picked is the same.\nSince I want to know how many more tomatoes does the farmer have left in his garden, I will consider that I have 124 out of the 177 tomatoes in my hands.

How far did the frog jump?", "correct answer": 58.0, "llm answer": "11", "confidence": 0.8, "probing response": "80%\nReasoning:\nBecause the mouse's jump distance was 94 inches less than the frog's, we can know that the mouse's jump distance was x-94, where x is the frog's jump distance. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can know that the frog's jump distance was x=19+39. Then we can solve for the mouse's jump distance:\nx-94 = x-94\\\\ x-94 = 19+39-94\\\\ -94 = -36\\\\ The mouse jumped -94=-36 inches\nTherefore the frog jumped 19+39=58 inches, which is the same distance the mouse jumped backward.\nBecause we have two possible answers, 11 and 58, we need to determine which answer to give. In our case, we need to use our confidence. Because our confidence is 80%, we will give the answer we are 80% confident in.

It's hard to do reasoning and then select from the possible answers, so we should focus on using the keywords to calculate the correct answer directly, and then to compare it to the 3 possible answers.\nKeywords have numbers, 29, 26, and 3. And the answer should be a whole number as well, which further narrows down the scope of our reasoning. To calculate the answer using these keywords, we have to think of ways to calculate 29-26 or 26-29.\nOne way is that 3 = 29-26, which is a simple subtraction. Another way is that 3 = 26-(26-29) or 26-(29-26), which are subtraction within parenthesis.\nSince this question is about reasoning with numbers, it's better to reason with numbers instead of symbols, so 3 = 26-(26-29) is preferable.

In 1 day, there are 252 pickers, each filling 108 drums of grapes, which gives 252x108=27096 drums. Since the question is asking for 58 days, we have to multiply it by 58, which gives 27096x58=1572688 drums. Now, we have to divide this answer by 108 to get the total number of drums, which gives 1572688/108=14586.667.

The total number of pages he needs to read to complete all books is 66*492/12=3096. If he reads 5.5 pages per day, it will take him 3096/5.5=561 days, which is not possible. The only way to get a smaller number of days to read all the books is to read fewer pages each day. However, reading less pages each day would take more than 492 days, which is not possible. Therefore, the answer 2716 pages is not correct.\nPossible Answer: 33.6 days\nKeywords during reasoning to the possible answer: ['66 pages', '12 days', '33.6 days']\nThe question mentions the amount of pages in each book (66), the time taken to read one book ("}

How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "22", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: Let x be the number of pages of math homework that Rachel had. We know that she had 4 pages of reading homework, and 19 pages of biology homework. Therefore, x = 7 + 19 = 26, so Rachel had 26 pages of math homework. We also know that she had 4 pages of reading homework. To find the number of pages of math homework that she had that is greater than the number of pages of reading homework, we subtract 4 from 26, which is 22. Therefore, she had 22 more pages of math homework than reading homework.\nConfidence: 20%\nExplanation: The answer is 22. This is because the problem is asking for the number of pages of math homework that Rachel had that is greater than the number of pages of reading homework. To solve this, we subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework. 4 pages of reading homework minus 7 pages of math homework equals -3 pages of reading homework, which is less than 0. This means that 7 pages of math homework is more than 4 pages of reading homework, and 22 pages of math homework is more than 4 pages of reading homework"}
