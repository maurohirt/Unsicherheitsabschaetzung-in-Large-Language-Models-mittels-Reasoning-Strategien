How many salty cookies did Paco have left?", "correct answer": 17.0, "llm answer": "Paco has 17 salty cookies left.", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\nExplanation: There are only two possible cases left that Paco has 15 or 17 salty cookies left. For the 15 case, Paco would have eaten 11 sweet cookies, 6 salty cookies, and 9 sweet cookies, and 2 salty cookies left. This is possible, because Paco would have 17 sweet cookies, 26 salty cookies and 14 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies before eating anything. But it is unlikely that Paco would eat 11 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies and leave the sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies behind. Also the case that Paco would eat 13 sweet cookies, 11 salty cookies, and 3 sweet cookies, and 6 salty cookies left is possible, but unlikely as Paco would have to eat 2 sweet cookies and 3 salty cookies before eating a sweet cookie and leaving 3 sweet cookies behind, this seems unlikely. Therefore it is more likely that Paco ate the sweet cookies first and left 3 sweet cookies behind. And the more likely case is Paco has 17 salty cookies left.\nA: [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75"}

We can only compute Marco's dad's weight using subtraction: We can subtract 8 pounds from the initial 36 pounds to calculate the dad's initial strawberries weight.  36 - 8 = 28. We can subtract Marco's remaining 12 pounds from his dad's initial 28 pounds to compute his dad's remaining weight.  28 - 12 = 16.

Step 3: Helen baked 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning. Step 4: Helen baked a total of 19 + 231 + 237 = 487 raisin cookies. Step 5: We know that Helen baked 487 raisin cookies. However, we do not know how many of these are chocolate chip cookies and how many are raisin cookies. Step 6: Helen baked a total of 487 raisin cookies. Since she baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday, we know that she baked a total of 19 chocolate chip cookies. Since she baked 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning, we know that she baked a total of 19 + 237 = 256 chocolate chip cookies. Since we know the total number of chocolate chip cookies baked by Helen (256), we can find the difference between this number and the total number of raisin cookies baked by Helen (487). It is 256 - 487 = -231. Final Answer"}
{"question": "Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had some bags of cans. The next day she found 4 more bags worth of cans. If she had a total of 8 bags altogether.

The number of bags on Monday could be 1 or 2 instead. However, the number of bags on Monday is 4, which is a more likely answer.\n\n---\n\nThis is not really how you would do this problem. If you have 8 bags and add 4 more, you have 12 total, not 8.  But, let's try to apply the math.\n\nIf Tiffany has 4 bags on Monday, she would have 4 more bags on Tuesday. That would mean she had a total of 8 bags. If Tiffany had a total of 8 bags, she would have 4 bags on Monday. This means we are just describing the same thing over and over. We could get more specific though.\n\nIf Tiffany had 4 bags on Monday, she would have 8 total bags. We can then subtract the amount she had on Monday to see how many bags she had on Tuesday. That would be 8-4=4 bags.\n\nOr, if Tiffany had 4 bags on Tuesday, she would have 4 total bags. We can then subtract the amount she had on Tuesday to see how many bags she had on Monday.

How many bottles of diet soda did they have?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8 bottles", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: Given the reasoning steps mentioned, we can see that the grocery store had 9 bottles of regular soda and the rest of the bottles were diet soda. Therefore, the number of bottles of diet soda can be determined by subtracting the number of bottles of regular soda from the total number of bottles. Since there were 9 bottles of regular soda and the total number of bottles was 17, the number of diet soda bottles would be 17 – 9 = 8.\nQ: Considering these reasoning steps as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

When comparing two quantities, it is important to use the right comparison operators. In this case, you should use \"more\" rather than \"less.\" \"More\" indicates a greater value, whereas \"less\" indicates a smaller value. Since there are 7 birds, which is greater than the 4 storks, the correct comparison operator should be \"more.\"\n    2. When comparing two quantities, it is also important to consider the order in which the comparison is made. In this case, it is unclear whether the comparison is being made between the total number of animals (11) or the difference between the two quantities (3).

The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 5 cups of sugar and 49 cups of salt. She already put in 11 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add? Possible Answer: 10\nThe first thing to do is to determine the total amount of flour that is required by the recipe. This can be done by adding the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together. Therefore, the total amount of flour required by the recipe is 12 cups of flour + 5 cups of sugar + 4 cups of salt = 21 cups of flour.\nNext, we need to compute the amount of flour that Mary has already added. She has already added 11 cups of flour. Therefore, we know that Mary has 11 cups of flour.\nNow that we have the total amount of flour required and the amount of flour that Mary has already added, we can compute the amount of flour that is still needed. To do this, we simply subtract the amount of flour that Mary has already added from the total amount of flour required. Therefore, 21 cups of flour - 11 cups of flour = 10 cups of flour are still needed.\nFinally"}

The number of peaches Steven has is given as 8, so the number of peaches Jake has must be at least 8 - 17 = -9. Because the number of apples Jake has must be at least 25, and the number of peaches Jake has must be at least -9, Jake must have at least 25 - (-9) = 34 total fruit.

Therefore, the new balance is the original balance minus the total amount spent, which is the original balance - ($6 + $16).\nStep 3: We have not been given the information about how much money Edward has in his wallet when he bought the books and pens. Hence, the original balance is not known. In Step 2, we are assuming that the original balance is 0. But, even if it was not, the same procedure will lead to the same answer, which is $19 - $22 = -$3.\nSince the answer is the new balance minus the amount spent, and we have not been given the information about the original balance, we are sure that the answer is correct if the new balance is not 0.\nThis gives the confidence level of 99.99%."}

If there were 8 different books and 21 different movies, we have a total of 29 items in the 'crazy silly school' series. Of which we know, the problem gives us the following information: we have watched 7 books and 4 movies. We do not know how many items are left.

In order to calculate the difference between the number of items you still have to watch and the total number of items, we need to know how many items are left. If you have 29 items and you know 7 of them are books and 4 are movies, you still have 29 − 7 − 4 = 18 left. So, if we know 18 are left, we can determine the answer of the problem.

For Julia to play tag with 10 kids, she can do so in 10! ways. We want to know if Julia played tag with more kids on Monday than she did on Tuesday. Since we know the exact numbers and their difference (18-10=8), we don't need to do anything but count the possible ways Julia played tag with exactly 8 more kids on Monday than she did on Tuesday. 18! = (18 x 17 x 16 x... x 2 x 1) 10! = (10 x 9 x 8 x... x 2 x 1) The number of ways Julia played tag with exactly 8 more kids on Monday is the same as the number of ways you can make 8 groups of 10 from a group of 18. So you are looking at 18! / (10!)^8. Since there is only 1 way to arrange 10! numbers, 18! / (10!)^8 = (18 x 17 x 16 x... x 2 x 1) / (10 x 9 x 8"}

How many pages does the book have altogether?", "correct answer": 1891.0, "llm answer": "1,891", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nThe correct answer is 1,891 and here is my reasoning:\n\nThere are 31 chapters, each with 61 pages. To find the total number of pages, we multiply 31 by 61. This gives us 1,891 pages. This is the correct answer because it matches the provided information. I am 60% confident in my answer because I have checked the calculations and they seem correct.\n\nIn this reasoning, I have used the principle of multiplication. By multiplying the number of chapters by the number of pages in each chapter, I am able to find the total number of pages in the book. This principle is based on the idea that if there are two groups of items, and you know the number of items in each group, then you can find the total number of items by multiplying the two numbers together. In this case, we have two groups of items: chapters and pages. We know that there are 31 chapters and 61 pages in each chapter. By multiplying these numbers together, we get 1,891 pages, which is the total number of pages in the book. This reasoning is valid because it uses the correct calculations and follows the principle of multiplication."}

How many more crayons did he lose than those he gave to his friends?", "correct answer": 322.0, "llm answer": "Paul lost more crayons than those he gave to", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: We are given the following information:\nPaul got a box of 110 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 90 crayons to his friends while he lost 4 1/2 crayons.\nIf 90 crayons were given to Paul’s friends and 4 1/2 crayons were lost, there are 4 1/2 + 90 = 94 1/2 crayons in total. Since 4 1/2 crayons are lost, the remaining crayons are 94 1/2 - 4 1/2 = 90 crayons.\nSince 90 crayons are remaining after 90 crayons were given away, and 90 crayons were also given away, Paul did not have enough crayons to give to his friends.\nWe also know that 4 1/2 crayons are lost and 90 crayons were given to Paul’s friends. Therefore, Paul lost more crayons than those he gave to his friends.\nPossible Answer: Paul lost more crayons than those he gave to\nExplanation: Paul got a box of 110 crayons for his birthday.

Only 9 and 17 are factors of 153, so we can choose either 9 or 17 as the answer.\n2. Alternatively, we can use the reasoning given in the problem to solve it. Let x be the number of bottles Debby drank each day. Then, 17x = 153. Solving for x, we get x = 9.\nHence, the answer is 9.\nWhy the other two answers cannot be correct:\nThe other two answers cannot be correct because they are not factors of 153. In other words, they cannot be used to solve the problem in a reasonable way.```"}

Here is a sample answer with reasoning and confidence level:\n```Reasoning: The total number of people who were present in the program can be calculated by adding the number of parents, pupils, and teachers. Since the number of parents, pupils, and teachers are all whole numbers, we can assume that each parent has 1 child (pupil), and each teacher has 1 pupil as a student. Therefore, the total number of people who were present in the program is 73 + 724 + 744 = 1541.\nConfidence: I have a 100% confidence in my reasoning because I used addition to calculate the total number of people and I assumed that each parent has 1 child and each teacher has 1 pupil as a student.

{"question": "Frank had 33 pieces of candy. He lost 24 of them. If he put the remaining pieces into bags with 9 pieces in each bag. How many bags would he have?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "1 bag with 0 pieces", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: The number of bags is the total number of pieces divided by the number of pieces in each bag.

{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour. How many cups of flour did she put in?", "correct answer": 1.0, "llm answer": "14", "confidence": 0.4, "probing response": "40%\n```\n\nSolution: Given the following steps:\nStep 1: Identify the amount of flour needed. The recipe calls for 13 cups of flour. The Mary needs 12 more cups of flour for the cake.\nStep 2: Calculate the remaining flour needed. Subtract the cups of flour she already added from the total cups of flour she needs. 13 - X = 12. Therefore X = 1. \nStep 3: Compute the total amount of flour. Add the 13 cups of flour and the 1 cup she still needs to get 14 cups.\nFrom step 1 and 2 we can infer that she added 1 cup of flour already. From step 3, we know that she still needs 1 more cup to finish off her recipe, which adds up to 2 cups total. However, we don't know if she added any other ingredients or skipped any steps in making this cake (e.g., adding butter). It could be possible that she only measured out 5 cups instead of 13 cups, in which case she would still have 8 more cups left over. Or it could be that she made a mistake in her calculations and added too much flour, requiring her to add additional ingredients like milk or"}

How many invitations will be left?", "correct answer": 68.0, "llm answer": "66", "confidence": 0.05, "probing response": "5%\nExplanation: We first make a few reasonable assumptions. The number of friends she sent invitations to is not more than the total number of invitations she sent. So, Carol can not send 70 invitations, otherwise she runs out of invites. And also she can not send 0 invitations to her friends. So, the answer is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.\nWe then consider the possible reasoning steps.\nIn Step 1, it is reasonable to count how many packs of invites she bought. We know that 70 is the product of 10 and another number. So, 70 is not only a multiple of 10, but also a factor of 70. So, Carol bought 7 packs of invites.\nIn Step 2, if Carol sends to 2 friends, then there are 2 × 2 = 4 invites left. So, the answer should be 66. The probability that the answer 66 is correct is 100%."}

It is more reasonable that there are less people than the total number of seats. The reasoning above is not a comprehensive or detailed reasoning. In real questions, there are usually much more information and you should use all available information when making an answer.\nPossible Answer: 61\nA step-by-step reasoning to the possible answer: Step 1: Compute the number of seats available. There were 44 seats available.\nStep 2: Determine the number of people in the program. Since the number of seats available is less than the total number of people (61 + 177 = 238), the number of people in the program should be no more than the number of seats. Therefore, the number of people in the program is at most 44.\nStep 3: Subtract the number of seats available (44) from the total number of people (238) to get the number of people who were present in the program, 238 - 44 = 194.\nStep 4: Since there were 61 parents in the program, the number of pupils should be 194 - 61 = 133.\nFinal Answer: 61"}

How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?", "correct answer": 89.0, "llm answer": "1 cake more than pastry", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: Step 1: Consider the question stem.

Step 2: Now consider the second step. There are 153 pastries and we have 8 pastries sold. So, the number of pastries sold is 8 ÷ 153 = 0.052, rounded to 0. Let’s look at the question stem again. How many more cakes than pastries? If we look at 6.86 cakes, rounded to 7 cakes, we get a positive number. If we look at 0.052 pastries, we get a negative number.

Option 1 is impossible because Matthew would give his friends 1 cake each, which is not divisible. Option 2 is impossible because Matthew would give 11 of his friends 1 cake each, which is not divisible. Option 3 is impossible because Matthew would give 11 of his friends 1 cake each, which is not divisible. Option 4 is impossible because Matthew would give 11 of his friends 1 cake each, which is not divisible.\nQ: If Matthew shared 22 crackers and 34 cakes evenly among his 11 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?\nExplanation: The only way this can work is if each person ate 2 crackers and 3 cakes. 22 ÷ 11 = 2, so each person got 2 crackers. 34 ÷ 11 = 3, so each person got 3 cakes. So the correct answer is 2 crackers.\nExplanation: If Matthew gave 22 crackers and 34 cakes to his friends, then each friend received 2 crackers and 3 cakes. 22 crackers ÷ 11 friends = 2 crackers, and 34 cakes ÷ 11 friends ="}

How many bird families live near the mountain now?", "correct answer": 105.0, "llm answer": "105", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\nExplanation: The answer is likely correct because it is the only option that meets the criteria of the problem. All other options violate the mathematical principle of addition (not the principle of multiplication). The problem says that 18 new bird families joined 87 bird families and asks how many bird families there are now. The correct answer, therefore, should be 105, which is 87 + 18. Option A and option C, which have values greater than 105, do not meet this criteria. Option D is equal to 18 + 18, which is the number of new bird families plus itself. This is not correct, because the problem did not state that 18 new bird families joined 18 new bird families. Option B is equal to 87 + 87. This violates the mathematical principle of addition because it does not account for the new bird families. The answer, therefore, is unlikely correct because it does not meet the criteria of the problem."}

The second reasoning step tells us Danny had at least 66 wrappers. The third reasoning step tells us Danny had at most 134 wrappers. Therefore, Danny had between 66 and 134 wrappers before finding wrappers at the park. The fourth reasoning step tells us Danny had 39 bottle caps before finding wrappers at the park. This means Danny had fewer than 39 bottle caps before finding wrappers at the park, so Danny must have had at most 39 bottle caps. The fifth reasoning step tells us Danny had at most 39 bottle caps. The sixth reasoning step tells us Danny had between 66 and 134 wrappers and at most 39 bottle caps. The seventh reasoning step tells us Danny had between 66 and 134 wrappers and between 39 and 16 bottle caps.

Thus, I consider the distance for the frog is 33 more than the grasshopper.  \nStep 2: Find the answer of 52 (mouse distance). The reasoning for this answer is: ```I do not understand the problem well, but the description of \"5 inches lesser than\" may be similar to the description of \"5 inches smaller than\", which is \"5 inches less than\". Therefore, I consider the distance for the mouse is 5 less than the frog distance (which is 57)```.  \nStep 3: The reasoning for 28 inches to be the correct answer is: ```I noticed the distance for the mouse (52) is much more than the grasshopper (24), and I remember my previous conclusion that 5 inches is the distance between the frog and mouse, therefore 28 inches is 5 x 5 + 2 = "}

So we know that the numbers of books and movies must be finite and we know the lower bound on the number of movies and the upper bound on the number of books.  \nSo we first subtracted the number of books to get the number of books left and subtracted the number of movies watched to get the number of movies left. Then we compared the two numbers and came to the conclusion that there are 0 movies left to watch. \n\nA bit of statistics to make the argument stronger. The probability of 0 left to watch being the correct answer is at least 90% based on the following analysis.  \nFirst, since there are 17 movies, the maximum number of movies left to watch can be 17 - 7 = 10. If there are at least 10 movies left to watch, then there is a 100% chance that 0 is the correct answer.

You are right in saying that the problem has a variable set of chairs, but you can't make that variable into any number. You must think of the chairs as an actual set of objects.

{"question": "Rachel picked 4 apples from her tree. If the tree had 7 apples initially. How many apples are still there on the tree?", "correct answer": 3.0, "llm answer": "3", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\nReasoning: The question asks how likely answer 3 is to be correct, which we can answer by calculating the conditional probability P(Answer=3|given the additional information). Based on the given steps, we know that the tree started with 7 apples, Rachel took 4 of them away, and there were 3 apples remaining. Therefore, we can rewrite the question as P(3 apples remained|7 apples at the start and 4 were taken away). This can be simplified to P(3 remained) using the chain rule of probability. Now, the question becomes how likely it is that there were 3 apples remaining after Rachel took away 4 apples. We can find this by considering the possible combinations of apples that could have been left on the tree. These combinations include {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4}, and {4}. The probability of each of these combinations can be calculated by dividing the number of possible outcomes for each combination by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4"}

{"question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.

How much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse?", "correct answer": 41.0, "llm answer": "12", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\nExplanation: The grasshopper is jumping 25 inches farther than the frog so the frog is jumping 21-25 = 4 inches. The mouse is jumping 4 inches less than that, which means it is jumping 21-4 = 17 inches. The difference between the grasshopper and the mouse is then 21 - 17 = 4 inches.\nConfidence: 50%\nExplanation: We have to find the difference between the grasshopper and the mouse. The grasshopper is 25 inches farther than the frog. The mouse is 16 inches shorter than the frog. If we make the frog our reference, the grasshopper is 25-0 = 25 inches farther than the mouse. Therefore the answer is 25 inches."}

If you follow the reasoning, you can see that it is not a good idea to have the initial number of roses equal to 0. It makes more sense to start from 1, because at the beginning there must be some roses in the vase.\nStep 2: After changing the first step to x be the number of roses in the vase at the beginning (not including the 16 roses that were added later), we have to adjust the remaining steps accordingly.\nStep 3: In this step, we need to count the number of roses that were in the vase originally. We know there were 23 roses, but 16 of them were added later. That means the vase already had 23 - 16 = 7 roses at the beginning.\nFinal Answer: 7\nQ: Considering the above reasoning, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog. We can conclude that the frog jumped 19 inches less than the grasshopper. We can also conclude that the frog jumped 12 inches less than the mouse. This means that the frog and the mouse must have jumped the same distance, because the frog jumped 19 inches less than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse must have jumped 19 + 12 = 31 inches. So the frog and the mouse must have jumped 31 inches. We can conclude that the mouse jumped 12 inches less than the frog, so the mouse must have jumped 31 - 12 = 19 inches.

We are then asked to find the depth of the water, based on the given information.  \nTo solve this problem, we first need to determine the height of Dean. We know that Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron, which means that his height is 15 feet - 6 feet = 9 feet.  \nNext, we need to compute the depth of the water. We know that the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 9 x 9 = 81 feet.  \nFinally, we identify the depth of the water as 81 feet, based on our calculations.  \nOverall, by following these steps, we can find the depth of the water in which the two swimmers are swimming."}
