The first section opens with a guitar tolling, like a church bell, with no introduction, leading into a verse with Mercury singing the song's title word. It shifts into a second section that begins with Mercury singing the question \"Is this the real life?\", followed by the refrain \"No, it's just a fantasy\".

It's not because I'm lazy, it's because I don't feel comfortable with the keywords. To be honest, I'm not sure what \"pop duo\" and \"debut international album\" means. If these keywords mean the first released album by a duo who sing pop songs, it doesn't make much sense to me, because the question is about the debut album by a duo, not the album released internationally. I'd say it would be more reasonable to think about it as an album by the duo, rather than an album that is popular in one country.\nIn terms of the song, I think \"Black or White\" would be more likely to be the first hit single of the duo. \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\" is a song that is more likely to be a cover song. So, \"Black or White\" would be the first hit single of the duo, and I think the keywords are very helpful here.\n\nQ: Considering these keywords as additional information, how likely is the above answer to be correct?

And The Godfather 2 was released in 1974. Therefore, this is 2 decades, so the movie should have been more based on the book than the reality, since The Godfather 3 was released in 1990. Therefore, they used real people's name in the 3rd part. But also, in real life, there was a real person called Vizzini. \n\nSo, it is quite possible that they used this real person to base the character.\n\nVizzini is in The Godfather 2 (he is in the bar at the beginning where Don Corleone visits a high class restaurant for a wedding). Therefore, this seems quite plausible to me, even though he is not a main antagonist in The Godfather 2. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the answer Vizzini is correct.\n```"}

The only reason I chose 'unicameral' is because there is no other legislative branch in this sentence.\nHowever, 'whose composition is what' tells us that there is something more to the sentence and that this'something' is related to 'composition'.\n'Composition' is the way something is organized and put together, so I think the sentence is talking about a system of a government and it's composition.\nThen I think the word 'branch' means a part of this system, and 'legislative' means the part of the system that makes laws. Since 'whose' is used, I think the sentence is talking about a person who has been serving in both branches of legislative. That is, this person has been serving in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the USA.\nSo the answer should be bicameral because there are two chambers in the Legislative branch of the US government."}

It was first introduced in 1984 and became one of the most popular SUVs in its class. However, its design was heavily influenced by another luxury SUV from the British brand Land Rover, known as the Range Rover.\nThe Jeep Cherokee and Range Rover share many similarities in their design and features.

However, we can use other clues to estimate the confidence of our choice. For instance, we could consider the genre of the film (musical, romantic, thriller), its actors (Asawari Joshi), and its release year (2008). By comparing these factors with other films of similar genres, we can estimate the probability of our answer being correct. For example, we might find that most musical romantic drama thrillers from 2008 feature well-known Indian actresses, which would increase our confidence in Gandhi, My Father being correct. On the other hand, if we discovered that many musical romantic drama thrillers from 2008 had unknown Indian actresses, our confidence in Gandhi, My Father being correct would decrease. Overall, without additional information such as film titles or synopses, it's difficult to determine with absolute certainty whether Gandhi, My Father is indeed the correct answer.

Similarly, considering '672 BCE', we can infer that the answer should not be The oldest copies of the I, as it does not date back to 672 BCE.

Considering the year, 1965, in the question, the answer can't be from a borough in New York City since New York City did not exist as a city in 1965.\n2. 'Arlington' seems like a place name, so it could be a country, city or region. If it's a city, the correct answer must be a city in the USA, because 'drafted' is a verb meaning taking someone or something into military service. Drafted can only happen in the USA. If it's a country, the correct answer could be from a different country, like China, India, England, etc. The context of the sentence indicates that Arlington is not a country but probably a city, borough or county in the USA, since 'drafted' and 'base' indicates the correct answer must be a city or borough in the USA.\n3. Since Arlington is not a borough in New York City, and Arlington is a city in Texas, the correct answer could be a borough in Texas.

Thus, we will reason as following:\n- `Born in 1974` means nothing because we don't know which day or year the star was born.

First, we know that the woman was born in 1890. In this case, the \"first lady of civil rights\" is probably a known figure. According to Wikipedia, \"the first lady of civil rights\" is referred to Rosa Parks, which was born in 1913 and died in 2005. Thus, the \"first lady of civil rights\" refers to someone who is older than 1913. Because the unit number is 36 and this is an apartment building and not a row of houses, it is unlikely that the apartment number is an exact year of birth. Therefore, the unit number may refer to a relative year of birth. The keywords 1890, 1926 minus 1890, and 36 could be interpreted as two additional pieces of information: \"the first lady of civil rights\" was born in 1926 and lived in unit number 36 for two decades, or the first lady was born in 1890 and died in unit 36 in 1926 minus 1890.

Then the total number of days that have passed is $T\\times365$, and the total number of days for which the park has been open is $(T-40)\\times365$ (the number of days the park has been open is less than the total number of days that have passed by $40\\times365$). We are given that $$(T-40)\\times365 = 29,660.$$\nWe first multiply both sides by $\\frac{365}{365}$ to get $$(T-40)\\times365 \\times \\frac{365}{365} = 29,660\\times \\frac{365}{365}.$$\nSince $\\frac{365}{365} = 1$, this simplifies to $$(T-40)\\times365 = 29,660\\times 365.$$\nTherefore"}

In the 6 years between these two events, Robinson Canó is the most similar person.\nThe only other clue in the question that gives some hint is that the home run derby is in the context of baseball. From this context, I know the baseball players who are active are more likely to win a home run derby than those who are retired. \nThis reasoning leads me to believe that Robinson Canó is more likely to win the 2007 State Farm Home Run Derby than Albert Pujols or David Ortiz. \n\nHowever, in my reasoning, I may be making a mistake that I am comparing different people in different ages. This mistake could be avoided by focusing more on Robinson Canó and David Ortiz's careers after 2001 instead of thinking more"}

Simpson was murdered. The title \"Juice on the Loose\" might be related to \"Juice on the Loose\" sports documentary. I've only heard of George Romero's movie \"Night of the Living Dead\", but maybe this one was based on his work too. The author also gave a hint by mentioning that No one re-released the documentary. It might be a joke because George Romero did not make any more films after his death in 2017.\n\nThe possible answer is incorrect because the year '1994' does not fit with O.J. Simpson's murder or George Romero's other movies. I think the author has mixed up two different things here. The original title of the movie is \"The Night of the Living Dead\". It was first released in 1968 and later re-released in 1994. The reason for this was that George Romero made a sequel to the original film, titled \"Night of the Living Dead 2\" (released in 2005), which features a new story line but still uses some"}

However, the show is a spin-off of 'The Tonight Show', which is the show the question is talking about. \n\nIt is hard to imagine why a question about a talk show would not have the name of the show itself as the keyword, but it does have the name of a famous actor who previously hosted the show as the keyword. We should therefore think that there is a reason why the question is asking for the name of the host who hosted it after Conan O'Brien, who has a reputation as being one of the funniest people in show business. We therefore guess that it is the same comedian, Conan O'Brien, but that he changed his name for the show so that the audience would not confuse him with the actor who previously hosted the show. That's why the keyword is 'fun size'. \n\nAlthough the keyword is not the name of the show itself, the keyword 'Conan' does appear in the answer. So, when we get the question right, it will also be right that Conan O'Brien is the host of the show. This shows that the answer is highly likely. \n\nQ: There is a question"}

I'm not a music expert and I'm sure there is some nuance that I'm missing, but to the best of my knowledge (also I'm asking my friends to fact-check with me):\nThe question asks about an opera and the composer. If an opera is composed, there is a libretto for it, and I haven't heard of any non-italian libretto being used by Monteverdi. So I think it's highly unlikely that the composer is anyone other than Monteverdi.\n\nThe possible answers are all in latin, which seems to suggest the topic is something historical, and the keywords also suggest it's something French, which is not Monteverdi's mother tongue.

However, since \"Lorde\" is one of the possible answers, the question might be about someone in the music industry. Lorde was the person who found a music artist and paired him/her with a lyricist. In this case, I would guess that Lorde was the person who found Taylor Swift and paired her with the co-lyricist of \"Yellow Flicker Beat\". Lorde is also a famous musician, so she could have been the person who found someone else and paired them with a lyricist. Overall, I believe that the probability of Lorde being the correct answer is 100%.\n"}

The USS Nautilus was powered by a pressurized water reactor, which was designed and built by the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), a laboratory located in Schenectady, New York.\nZalman Shapiro was the founding director of KAPL and was responsible for its early success in designing and building nuclear power reactors for submarines. Shapiro's work on the submarine reactor was a key part of the development of the nuclear navy and the subsequent expansion of naval power. The USS Nautilus was the first ship to be powered by a nuclear reactor and the first ship to make a submerged transit across the Pacific Ocean.

Evita was born in 1919, which is 33 years before 1952. Furthermore, she was assassinated on July 26, 1952, which aligns with the keyword \"67 years ago,\" as 1952 minus 67 equals 1985. This is further supported by the keyword \"50 years ago,\" as 1985 minus 50 equals 1935. The keyword \"50 years ago\" can also be interpreted as 1952 minus 50, which gives the year 1902. This interpretation is less likely to be correct, but it is still within the plausible range of possibilities considering the provided information.\n\nIn summary, considering the keywords, the most likely year for the titular character in Evita to have died is 1952, as it aligns with the keywords \"1952,\" \"67 years ago,\" and \"50 years ago\" when they are combined.```"}

Frank Baum", "confidence": 0.95, "probing response": "95%\n\nExplanation: \"Happy golden years\" is an idiom meaning \"The Golden Years\", which is a phrase referring to retirement or old age. L. Frank Baum is the author of the \"Oz\" book series, which is one of the most well-known book series in children's literature.\n\nThe keywords we're given are: \"1932\" (the year the book series started), \"1943\" (the year the book series ended), \"1900\" (the year of Baum's birth) and \"1920\" (the year of Baum's death). So the answer is \"L. Frank Baum\", who was born in 1900 and died in 1920, and wrote the \"Oz\" book series, which started in 1932 and ended in 1943.\n\nThere is a small chance that the answer is \"Margaret Hamilton\", who wrote the \"Journey to the Wizard of Oz\" book series, which started in 1939 and ended in 1944. However, this answer is less likely because the keywords given are \"1932\" and \"1943\", which do not match the dates of Hamilton's series. So the answer is most likely \"L. Frank Baum\"."}

{"question": "Who was the prime-time host of 12 Olympic Games that Michele O'Callaghan did makeup for?", "correct answer": "Robert Quinlan Costas", "llm answer": "Frank Gifford", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\n\n**Discussion**: This problem is about making connections between sports and television personalities from the 1980s. The keywords include some specific details about Michele O'Callaghan, the person being queried, and the prime-time host of the Olympic Games. The keywords do not provide any specific details about the Olympic Games themselves. Using these keywords, I would assume that the correct answer is Frank Gifford. The reasoning is as follows:\n\nFirst, the keywords indicate that the person being queried is an actress who has done makeup for the Olympic Games. This suggests that the person is associated with the entertainment industry, specifically the makeup industry, and has worked on events related to the Olympic Games. This narrows the possible answer to someone who is both a prime-time host of the Olympic Games and someone in the makeup industry. The keywords also suggest that the person being queried is in her 50s, as she worked for the Olympic Games in the 1980s.\n\nSecond, the keywords indicate that the person being queried has worked for 12 Olympic Games. This suggests that the person has a long-standing and well-known association with the Olympic Games, and is a prominent figure in the entertainment industry. This further narrows the possible answer to someone who is both a prime"}

The reasoning is:\n* It is most likely that the route has its own name that describes the route and destination. Hence, we are looking for a proper noun in the form of an adjective noun (e.g. rapid transit or high speed) + a proper noun (e.g. route or line). \n* We eliminate route 3 because there are no proper nouns for it. It does not make sense to name a bus route as 'route 3', so there are no proper nouns to consider. It is not a good idea to remove the adjective 'rapid' from rapid transit in a sentence that involves transit. That's a waste of a proper noun in a proper noun phrase.\n* We eliminate route 1 because there is no proper noun (e.g. Mall) that represents the destination of the route.\n* That leaves us with route 2, which is what the answer is, which is what the question says is the answer.\n* This reasoning is a special kind of reasoning (called abductive reasoning)."}

Its first cast included the Ballet Nacional de España, a company of young dancers founded by de Cárdenas in 1968. As de Cárdenas explained in an interview with the dance critic Rosalind Horner, the aim of the company was \"to give the Spanish dance a more popular style\", by incorporating flamenco and folk music into classical ballet. The Sandman is set to music by José Luis de la Parra, who, like de Cárdenas, was also a student of Alicia Alonso. Alonso, as well as Antonio Ruiz, were both early supporters of de Cárdenas and the company, and in 1976 the company became part of the Palau's Ballet de Barcelona.\n\nThe Sandman is a ballet in one act, based on a traditional Spanish fairy tale.

While Allan Bloom was a philosopher and a professor of philosophy, his main focus in the book is on the state of higher education and the decline of the study of the humanities, rather than specifically on philosophy.

Tournens ever see his mother again after his father disappears?\nPossible Answers: Yes, no, don't know\n\nThe correct answer is \"no\" - which is the correct answer based on my reading of the passage.\n\nHowever, the narrator never clarifies whether M. Tournens sees his mother again or not. The narrator does state that he \"never saw\" M. Tournens again, but this could imply that they parted ways on bad terms, which might lead to the belief that they never see each other again.\n\nI am not sure whether this question would be better phrased differently so as to more precisely clarify whether M.

The Three O'Clock broke up in 1987 and did not reform until 2000 (with a hiatus from 2007 to 2011). They are currently active as of 2017, so they are still going strong, just not as prominent.

That might be useful because each keyword can also be a property of a film.\n\nThis way it's easy to see that \"Lady Vengeance\" is a film, and it's also easy to see that it's a South Korean film.

{"question": "Who directed the film that Dominique McElligott filmed after she left the television series \"Raw\"?", "correct answer": "Anand Tucker", "llm answer": "Tommy Wirkola", "confidence": 0.6, "probing response": "60%\n\nExplanation: \n\nTo answer this question, I took a look at the Wikipedia article of the movie \"Raw\", which is a 2016 French horror film directed by Julia Ducournau. The article states that the film was the directorial debut of Ducournau and the film was based on the director's original screenplay. The film also stars Garance Marillier and was released on 12 February 2016 in France. According to the article, the film follows a veterinary student who has a craving for raw meat after discovering her vegetarian family are cannibals.\nTherefore, I think that the above answer is incorrect. It seems unlikely that Dominique McElligott, who starred as Emma Wilson in the British television series \"Raw\", would go on to direct a horror film after she left the series. She is not a director, and I cannot find any information about her directing any films. Therefore, it seems more likely that the correct answer is Tommy Wirkola, who is a Norwegian director and actor.\nI believe that the answer is probably Tommy Wirkola.

Since Zaffar Abbas is the current editor-in-chief of the newspaper Dawn, and the question mentions Dawn is sponsoring the initiative Aman ki Asha, we can deduce that Zaffar Abbas is probably the one who is the Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper that is sponsoring Aman ki Asha. \n\n\nReasoning to the other possible answer:\nThe question contains keywords 'Dawn' and 'Editor-in-Chief'. The question mentions Dawn is sponsoring the initiative Aman ki Asha. So, Dawn must be the newspaper sponsoring Aman ki Asha. As per the keywords 'Dawn' and 'Editor-in-Chief', Dawn must have an editor-in-chief, who is probably a person whose surname is Abbas. Since 'Abbas' is a common surname in Pakistan, there may be many people with this surname who are the editor-in-chiefs of various newspapers. Therefore, we can't be sure about the exact name of the person who is the editor-in-chief of the newspaper that is sponsoring Aman ki Asha.

Since, I didn't know any places of business in Madison and Seattle, I decided to check to see where they were. While I was at it, I also checked on Toppers Pizza as well. All of the business were in the northern hemisphere, and since Seattle and Chicago are roughly on the same latitude, I assumed they were both farther north than Toppers Pizza. I also realized that both are north of Madison and the equator.

But after looking at the movie list of Tom Cruise, I didn't find any movies with extraction as its title.

The St. Valentine's Day Massacre is one of the most infamous mob hits in American history and was a major turning point in the Prohibition-era gang war between Capone's Chicago Outfit and rival gangs such as Bugs Moran's North Side Gang. The massacre sparked widespread outrage and led to increased law enforcement efforts to crack down on organized crime.

City Hall does not seem to be a place but a tv drama about a political issue, and the year 1996 was around the time of Bill Clinton presidency.\nMy Lover, Madame Butterfly is not a place either, but probably a tv drama like City Hall. I don't think a drama named My Lover, Madame Butterfly could have aired in 1916 because 1916 was around the time of World War I.

This means that his birthday is on the 261st day of the year. To find out how many days there are in 1964, we need to subtract the year from 365, which gives us 365 - 1964 = 365 - 1964 = 1. Therefore, Andi Deris was born on the 261st day of 1964.\nAdam Levine was born on the 18th of March 1979. This means that his birthday is on the 78th day of the year. To find out how many days there are in 1979, we need to subtract the year from 365, which gives us 365 - 1979 = 365 - 1979 = 6. Therefore,"}

The player should be the one who reached '2,097 yards', and thus 'rushing yards'. 'Player' is a subject that should play football. The player should be helped to a '2,097 rushing yards season'. It is not clear if it is a 'rushing yard season', which means the player's own team's 'rushing yards' in a season, or it is the 'rushing yard season', which means the team's 'rushing yards' in a season. This question provides 'Jerome Felton' as a player and '2,097' as the yards. So, it should be the player's 'rushing yards', not his team's 'rushing yards'. 'College football' is the one that the player should play, which means the player should be 'college football player'. The player should be a 'college football player', thus 'college football' is a place he should play. So, 'where' should be 'college football'. 'College' and 'football' are two words should be combined in 'college football'. The two words should be separated. 'Football' and 'college'"}

If the sum of the points on the die is less than 10, the player loses the game.\n    The player can choose to continue rolling the die until the sum of the points on the die is equal to or greater than 10. If the player does not reach the target sum within three rolls, the game is over.\n    The university which released Diversions is located in Downtown Los Angeles, which is a very populated and busy area. The university is likely to be located in the center of the city, which would make it difficult for students to find a quiet and isolated area to play Diversions.

{"question": "Who created the economic idea of Freiwirtschaft?", "correct answer": "Silvio Gesell", "llm answer": "Silvio Gesell", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nReasoning: Gesell wrote the book Die Reformation im Münzwesen. It is a pamphlet written in 1893, about 120 years ago. There were a number of other important ideas created in that time period that could be considered. For example, there is Thorstein Veblen's \"conspicuous consumption\" idea and Alfred Marshall's idea of price elasticities of supply and demand. I am not sure how much overlap there is in the economics ideas between the two authors, but it is very clear that Veblen and Marshall were very different types of people. Veblen was from a poor family in rural Minnesota, and he spent most of his life as a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota. He did not have any economic education. Marshall, on the other hand, was a very well-connected person who attended the prestigious University of Cambridge and was a Fellow of King's College, where he spent most of his career as a professor of economics. It seems unlikely that Veblen would have been influenced by the idea of price elasticity of demand from Marshall, since he did not attend Cambridge.

Since she was born in the 20th century and was listed in the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame, she must have been at least 100 years old at the time of her inclusion in the hall of fame, which would put her birth year in the early 20th century.

The keywords provided in the question do not give any information about when the telescope was launched. The telescope may have been launched into space in 2002, but it was not launched into low Earth orbit until 2009.\n```This answer was marked as correct because it provides a reasonable explanation for the question. The question does not provide any information about when the telescope was launched, so there is no way to determine whether the answer is correct or not. However, the given answer suggests that the telescope was launched into space in 2002 but was not launched into low Earth orbit until 2009. This is a possible scenario, but it is not mentioned in the question, so it cannot be considered the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is \"No\"```\n"}

We need to look for a way to use these numbers to determine how many couples are involved in the dance. 4 is the first prime number and 5 is the second prime number, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the number of couples. We know that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse. Therefore, if we consider the legs of the right triangle to be 4 and 5, the hypotenuse must be 7. This means that there are 7 couples involved in the dance.\n\nQ: Considering the keywords, which of the following is true about the relationship between the numbers 4 and 5?\n```1: 4 is a factor of 5\n2: 5 is a factor of 4\n3: 4 and 5 are prime numbers\n4: None of the above```\nPossible Answer: 3\nExplanation: 4 and 5 are both prime numbers.

We can be sure of this from the text itself as well as from the date of the letter. It was written in 1939 and it seems most likely to have been sent to President Roosevelt at the time. The 1939 date is also the date of discovery of nuclear fission which Einstein, Szilárd and Fermi were trying to explain to Roosevelt. This letter led to Roosevelt ordering development of the atomic bomb, which would only have made sense if he was in office at the time, and this is supported by the date of his birth.

{"question": "Who did the QRA prioritize trying to intercept?", "correct answer": "Chinese and Russian aircraft", "llm answer": "The second missile (flying at 1500 meters per second)", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\nThe question requires you to consider the speed of the missile in addition to the altitude, and the altitude is not the deciding factor. The first missile (flying at 1000 meters per second) would be the most likely answer if the question was limited to the altitude of the missile. However, the addition of speed as a factor requires you to focus on the speed instead of altitude, and the missile that is faster (flying at 1500 meters per second) is the best candidate for interception. The QRA will need to get as close as possible to the missile and then shoot down the missile with a blast from the cannons on the plane. The slower the missile is, the longer the QRA will need to wait until the missile comes closer to their plane in order to shoot it down. Because of the higher speed of the second missile, the QRA will be able to intercept it sooner and more easily than the first missile, since the QRA only needs to wait 300 meters for the missile to reach them, rather than 700 meters for the first missile.\n\nThe QRA has multiple options of how to intercept the missile, but for now the question is limited to using the QRA's cannons to destroy the missile.

The answer is based on the time difference between the two given events, which is 5 years, which is the average interval between authors. The reasoning process is to compare the time difference between the two authors and determine the answer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFirst, we know that Clement Greenberg was a critic and art historian who wrote about art from 1939 to 1994. Second, we know that Isabel Colegate was a British author and literary agent who lived from 1931 to 2017.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to find out who was born earlier, because the author with the longer life span would have written more books and received more recognition in the art world.\n\nWe can look up the birth years of the two authors on Wikipedia or another reliable source. For Clement Greenberg, the birth year is listed as 1909, and for Isabel Colegate, the birth year is listed as 1931. This means that Clement Greenberg was born 22 years before Isabel Colegate.\n\nSince Clement Greenberg was born earlier, he would have had more time to write and receive recognition in the art world.

Therefore, Guideposts was not established until after the war ended.\n\nQ: After getting the answer, how easy was it to come up with the answer? Easy, Difficult\n```[your reasoning goes here]```\nA: The answer was easy to come up with because of the following: The first sentence of the question says that Dwell was founded first, so we can rule out Guideposts as an answer. The second sentence of the question says that Guideposts was founded in 2009, but Dweller was founded in 1945. This means that Guideposts was not established until after the war ended, so it cannot have been founded first. Therefore, the answer must be Dwell."}

However, if it's anything like American game shows, contestants try to beat professional athletes, which means they need to beat them by some kind of margin. For example, in Jeopardy!, players have to beat the \"champ\" by 5,000 points (not including final Jeopardy). So if the question is, \"How much will the champ have to win by?\" you would say something like: \"The champ will have to win by at least 5,000 points.\" This is how I've seen it done in other American game shows.\n\nThe champ is playing mixed martial arts against some random guy. This person has to beat him in a fight. If the question is, \"How much will this person have to win by?\" then you'd say something like: \"The person will have to win by at least one point.\" This is how I've seen it done in other American game shows.\n\nSo my reasoning is that since the person has to beat the champ, they need to beat him by more than just a single point. They need to beat him by a few points. So if they're playing mixed martial arts, they have to win by"}

Since 'Hold Me Tight' was released on 'Please Please Me' album, we can infer that the 'Please Please Me' album should be recorded before the Beatles' album (which we want to determine). \n\nThe date of release of the 'Please Please Me' album is 11/22/1963. To have the Beatles' album recorded after the 'Please Please Me' album, the Beatles' album should be released in 1964 or later. 'With the Beatles' album is released on 11/22/1963. Since the Beatles' album is released on the same date as 'Please Please Me', we know that it is recorded before 'Please Please Me'. Since the Beatles' album is released on the same date as 'Please Please Me', we know that it is recorded before 'Please Please Me'. Hence, 'With the Beatles' is the correct answer.\n"}

I didn't want to simply look at the keywords and jump to conclusions. That's why I spent more than a minute on this question.\n\nIn the last round, I used the 1927 keyword to rule out any university founded before that year (1900s) because I assumed that only universities founded later had varsity sports teams. This was obviously an invalid assumption. I could have ruled out many universities in the 20th century based on this assumption alone.\n\nI also assumed that a state university was more likely to have varsity sports teams than a private university. I based this assumption on the number of colleges and universities that I had heard of. However, this is a terrible assumption to make. I could have used the 15 keyword to rule out many universities regardless of whether they were private or state universities.\n\nIn the end, my reasoning was not good enough to solve this question correctly.

However, due to the rules of nomination, the books published in the last 10 years are not eligible for nomination.\n\nTherefore, the book was nominated in 1903, 1907, 1915, 1924, 1930, and 1943 Nobel Prizes in Literature, but it was not nominated in 1905 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe correct answer is 6.

Here are my reasons:\n1. The keywords provided are 1985 and Witness. Amanda Plummer appeared in the film Witness in 1985, making it one of her earliest roles. She played Rachel Lapp, a young Amish girl who witnesses a murder and becomes the target of the killers. This role helped establish Plummer's career and she continued to work in film and television for decades.\n2. Other actors who have appeared in the film Witness include Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, and Lukas Haas. However, Amanda Plummer is perhaps the most well-known and recognizable actor in the cast.\n3. Plummer has also had a successful career in theater, winning Tony Awards for her roles in The Real Thing and As You Like It.\nBased on these reasons, I believe the most likely answer is Amanda Plummer.

His work also helped spread the popularity of the Krti form, which consists of a composition divided into three sections: the pallavi, sthana, and anupallavi. The pallavi is a line which is repeated after each section and often carries a musical phrase or set of words which is then elaborated upon. The sthana is also often set to a different tune. All of the sections are meant to be sung in the same mode (raaga), and in the same time signature.

The first step is to identify keywords that can be used to help identify the relationship between rock band and rock music. In this question, the two keywords are \"Saving Abel\" and \"Sister Hazel\". By looking at the two keywords, we can see that Saving Abel is a rock band, while Sister Hazel is a rock music artist. From this information, we can conclude that the two keywords are not related. The next step is to identify the relationship between rock band and rock music. In this case, the relationship is that rock band is a type of rock music. Since the two keywords are not related, we can conclude that Saving Abel and Sister Hazel are not both rock bands.```\n"}

This tells us that the town may have recovered somewhat, but it is still below the 5,300 population in 2008.\nConsidering all of this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the population of the town where The Dame School is located was probably between 3,500 and 4,866 in 2011. The possible answer of 4 is therefore a reasonable answer."}

{"question": "Where is the main hub of the airline that sponsors a tournament at the Crete Golf Club", "correct answer": "Athens International Airport", "llm answer": "Dallas, Texas", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\n\nExplanation: The keyword \"Crete\" helps us find the answer. It can be either a city name in Greece, a city name in the US, or an island in the Pacific. The keyword \"airline\" implies that it is a city or island name in the US, since the airline industry is dominated by American airlines. If we look at the keywords \"1,000 miles\", it becomes clear that it is an island in the Pacific, which implies it is Hawaii, which is the only American territory in the Pacific. Therefore, Dallas is the answer.\n\nThe keyword \"Crete\" is a bit ambiguous, but we can infer the correct answer by considering the keywords \"airline\" and \"1,000 miles\". The airline industry is dominated by American airlines, which implies that \"Crete\" is a city or island name in the US. The keyword \"1,000 miles\" implies that it is an island in the Pacific, which is the only American territory in the Pacific. Therefore, \"Dallas, Texas\" is the answer.\n"}

The highway was planned and constructed as a cross country drive, which meant that communities along the route were set up for the needs of travelers rather than the local residents. In this new environment, the local communities, which had been developed around a central church, school, and mercantile store, were changed. Community members were no longer dependent on each other for everyday services, but relied on a network of businesses along the highway. This new lifestyle gave rise to communities such as Sunray, Texas, which is located south of Route 7. Today, Sunray is still a community but it has been changed from a town with a population of several hundred to a crossroads with a few hundred residents."}

The keywords, which can be easily found in the possible answer, are helpful to reason why this is the correct answer. For example, 'Denmark' in the keywords suggest that we need to find a country from the list of dynasties. So we only need to reason about the dynasty of Denmark. 'Dynasty' is the key keyword to reason why '1439' is the most likely year, because we want a dynasty and it is the latest year that can be a dynasty.

'1412' is the earliest year and doesn't help reasoning. The keyword 'during' suggests that we want to find a year. The keyword 'Dynasty' suggests that we want to find a dynasty and it is the latest year that can be a dynasty. The possible answer is a year range. Therefore, 1412-1439 is the only possible correct answer. Other answers are not dynasties of Denmark, including the dynasty of Iceland. The answer 'during the 1412-1439 years' is also a"}

For example, Ray Taylor may have been working in the American filmmaking for a long time before Jack Nicholson was born, and then they both started working at the same time. Another possible reason is that Jack Nicholson may have taken some time off from acting and Ray Taylor may have continued to work throughout this period.\n"}

In the movie, he is wearing a hat similar to the one in the first picture. \nRobert G. Vignola's movie \"The Lucky Dog\" is also a short. The second picture is taken from the movie. It was released in 1925. The third picture is taken from a movie released in 1927. The fourth picture is a publicity photograph of Semon. \nThe fifth picture is another photograph of Semon and the sixth one is a publicity photograph of Vignola. So they were working in 1927. The seventh picture is a movie poster of the movie with Laurel and Hardy. \nIt seems that Semon's hat was similar to the hat worn by Vignola and that Vignola had his hat similar to the one in the movie. And they were working together. And the poster of \"Dough and Dynamite\" is about them working in 1927. \nTherefore, it seems that Robert G.

Selke Trophy", "llm answer": "The Stanley Cup", "confidence": 0.9990000000000001, "probing response": "99.9%\nReasoning:\nThe question asks about a trophy won in 2016 by the brother of Gasper Kopitar. There is only one Stanley Cup, and it was won by the team with the most points at the end of the regular season. However, there are multiple other major trophies in sports that can be won by a single individual. For example, in professional golf, there is the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship. Similarly, in baseball there are the World Series, the All-Star Game MVP award, and the Rookie of the Year Award. In basketball there is the NBA Finals MVP award and in tennis there is Wimbledon. The only one that comes close to being unique among these types of awards is probably the Heisman Trophy in college football (and maybe even then it isn't). So given these facts alone it seems very unlikely that the correct answer would be \"The Stanley Cup.\""}
