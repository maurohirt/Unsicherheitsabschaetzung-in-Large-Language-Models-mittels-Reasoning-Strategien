Plutarch says that Claudius \"had married her, the daughter of Plautius, in the hope of getting children of his own; but as she had borne no children, he divorced her and took another wife, the daughter of Fulvia and Marc Antony.\"\nThe Latin word for \"hope\" is spes, which was a common Roman personal name, so Plutarch might have just been using a synonym. This is unlikely, since Dio uses a different word and both Plutarch and Dio call it a marriage. Both texts mention divorce without any reference to the children being adopted.

{"question": "Who is John Of Caesarea's paternal grandmother?", "correct answer": "Juliana Grenier", "llm answer": "Mariam", "confidence": 0.55, "probing response": "55%\nExplanation: The question asks about John of Caesarea's paternal grandmother. We know that a father's mother and mother's mother are the paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother, respectively. We also know that John of Caesarea is the maternal grandfather of Joseph of Arimathea. So, the paternal grandmother of John of Caesarea must be the mother of Joseph of Arimathea's mother. According to the genealogy, Joseph of Arimathea is the son of Jacob of Judaea and Mary Magdalene, and his mother is Maria Magdalene. We can thus deduce that the paternal grandmother of John of Caesarea is the mother of Maria Magdalene. We know from the genealogy that Mary Magdalene is the daughter of Mariam of Magdala and Simon Peter, and Mariam of Magdala is the daughter of Joachim and Hanna. So, Mariam of Magdala must be the mother of Maria Magdalene. Hence, the paternal grandmother of John of Caesarea is Mariam of Magdala.\n```Confidence: [the probability of answer Mariam to be correct, not the one you think correct, please only include the numerical number]%```"}

The only male with a grandfather named Albert was Albert, Sigismund's uncle.

He was 64 years old when he died. The answer on Wikipedia says Carl's father was named Carl Rustad and was born in 1934 and died in 1998, making him 64 years old when he died. If Carl was born in 1934, then he would have to be alive in 1998 in order for Carl to be his son. As the answer on Wikipedia does not state that Carl was still alive in 1998, I believe that the answer Carl Rustad is incorrect. However, I cannot be sure that the answer Carl Rustad is incorrect as there is no evidence that Carl's father was not still alive in 1998. \n\nConclusion: Although the answer on Wikipedia does not state that Carl was still alive in 1998, there is no evidence that he was not. Therefore, the answer Carl Rustad cannot be ruled out as incorrect. However, given the information on Wikipedia, I believe that the answer Carl Rustad is incorrect.\n"}

The other is that he was 40 years old in 1971. The reason the answer Infante Manuel, Count Of Ourém's paternal grandmother would have been born before 1531. is likely is because we can subtract 40 years from 1971 and get 1931. We then know Infante Manuel, Count Of Ourém was born before 1531 and this allows us to assume his paternal grandmother was born before 1531. The possible answer could be wrong because we can only assume the paternal grandmother was born before 1531. It could have been possible for his maternal grandmother to have been born before 1531, or his aunt could have been born before 1531 and she was the one who gave birth to him. If this were the case, then he wouldn't have been born before 1531.

The best way to approach this type of problem is to draw out a diagram of the family tree. The diagram will have many branches and sub-branches. The branches of the diagram will also have many nodes, representing the members of the family. The branches represent the relationships between the members of the family. The goal is to find the missing person by identifying the node that has the most connections to other nodes.\nFor this problem, we will draw out a diagram of the family tree, starting with Sir William Monson, 4th Baronet. We know that he was the paternal grandfather of Sir William Monson, 4th Baronet. Therefore, we will add him as a node in the diagram. We will then add his son, who is the father of Sir William Monson, 4th Baronet, as a node in the diagram. We will then add the son's wife, who is the mother of Sir William Monson, 4th Baronet, as a node in the diagram. We will then add Sir William Monson, 4th Baronet, as a node in the diagram.\nThe diagram will then have four nodes:"}
