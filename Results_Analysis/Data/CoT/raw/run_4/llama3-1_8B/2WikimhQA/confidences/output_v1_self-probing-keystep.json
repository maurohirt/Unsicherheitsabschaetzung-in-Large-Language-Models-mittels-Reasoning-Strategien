For example, when referring to an emperor in the Middle Ages, it refers to any of the Holy Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, or others. Even though Liechtenstein was ruled by the Habsburg monarchy during the Holy Roman Empire's existence, it did not become an empire until the nineteenth century, when the Austrian emperor was Francis II, who was also Holy Roman Emperor. Since Prince Franz De Paula is the paternal grandfather of Prince Franz De Paula, he was born in 1802. During this time, Francis II was the reigning emperor, so the most likely answer is Emperor Francis II.\n\n---\n\nPrince Franz De Paula Of Liechtenstein, sometimes known as Franz Joseph II, was born in 1802 in Vienna, Austria, as the son of Prince Karl Joseph Von Liechtenstein and Princess Maria Josepha Of Liechtenstein. He was the last ruler of the Liechtenstein dynasty. He died in 1858. He was succeeded by his son, Karl Joseph Von Liechtenstein, who was born in 1817 and who was the last emperor of Austria."}

Jesus Christ is Son of Mary.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nAccording to Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God and is called the Son of Man in the Bible.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nJesus was born to Mary and Joseph. Mary was born to Joachim and Anne, making Joseph and Mary brother and sister. Joseph is referred to as St. Joseph, and Mary is referred to as St. Mary. Joseph and Mary are siblings in Christianity, and Jesus is their son. Anne and Joachim are considered to be Mary's parents. Anne is called Saint Anne or Sobe, and Joachim is called Saint Joachim. Jesus is the son of Mary and the son of God, making him a cousin to his grandparents, Joachim and Sobe, according to Christianity.\n\n**Confidence**\n\nThe Bible mentions Jesus being the Son of God, and this is a well-established fact.

As far as I know, there are no more than three paternal grandfathers of Qiubo. Liu Xin himself has no younger brothers and no younger brothers of the paternal grandfather Liu Wu, so Liu Wu is excluded. The elder son of the second son of Liu Yin is Liu Bingyi, who was only named after the emperor's death. Liu Qi is a little too young to give a second son a name, so Liu Xiang, the paternal grandfather of Qiubo, is excluded. Therefore, only Liu Qin remains. However, since the second son of Liu Qin is Liu Xuan, it is very likely that Liu Xuan has given his son a name. In addition, Qiubo has a younger brother called Liu Zhi, so Liu Qin's grandson's grandson is Liu Qin. It is highly likely that he named his grandson Liu Qin. In addition, Liu Xuan himself has no younger brothers, so he is unlikely to have a younger brother to give him a name.\n"}

It is hard to narrow down the answer by finding the one who was alive in 1987.\n\n* Joseph Wenzel of Liechtenstein is a second-generation royal family member. This could narrow down the answer to 3 options: his parents, and his grandparents. The answer must be his paternal grandfather.\n\n* Considering the father-son relationship of Prince Albert and Hans-Adam, we can narrow down the answer to one option. As the prince was still alive when Prince Albert passed away, it has to be his father. We do not need to know Prince Albert's age to conclude his father's age. (I do not know the age of Prince Albert, and I do not know if this information is important for reasoning).\n\n* Considering the information that the prince passed away when he was 93 years old, and his grandfather was born in 1945, we can say that his grandfather was born between 1945-1915.

{"question": "Who is Judith (Hebrew Bible)'s sibling-in-law?", "correct answer": "Jacob", "llm answer": "Since the Bible never explicitly states the name of David's nephew, it's not possible to know the name of Judith's sibling", "confidence": 0.99, "probing response": "99%\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen we encounter a passage in a document where information is not explicitly stated, we need to rely on inferences from the rest of the passage to make our best guess as to the missing information. In this case, we can use the critical reasoning step to provide the missing information about the character Judith's sibling. If we assume that her sibling is a male who served as one of David's captains, we can infer that he is most likely the brother of Uriah, another one of David's captains who was married to Bathsheba. This would make Judith the sister-in-law of Bathsheba, who is mentioned several times throughout the Bible. Additionally, we can use other details from the passage to help us make our inference, such as the fact that Judith is described as a widow, which suggests that she was previously married to someone who has since passed away.\n\nTherefore, based on the critical reasoning step and the information provided in the passage, we can reasonably infer that Judith's sibling is Uriah, and that she is the sister-in-law of Bathsheba."}

{"question": "Who is Paul Cobb Methuen's paternal grandfather?", "correct answer": "Thomas Methuen", "llm answer": "Paul Cobb Methuen", "confidence": 0.85, "probing response": "85%\n\nSolution: First we need to know how the question relates to the fact, so that we can apply critical thinking. The relationship of this question and the fact are: \nThe question asks for who is Paul Cobb Methuen's paternal grandfather.\n\nNow that we know this, we can reason using what we know from the fact to determine if Paul Cobb Methuen is Paul Cobb Methuen's paternal grandfather. \n\nThe fact tells us that Paul Cobb Methuen's father is Sir Godfrey Vassall-Phillips, 6th Baronet. We also know that Alfred Methuen, 1st Baron Methuen is Sir Godfrey Vassall-Phillips, 6th Baronet's grandfather. This means that Paul Cobb Methuen's grandfather must be one of Alfred Methuen, 1st Baron Methuen's children, because they share a common grandparent. However, there is only one child that we know of who is alive today and has the title Lord Methuen. Therefore, we can reason that Paul Cobb Methuen's grandfather must be Robert Charles Methuen, 7th Baron Methuen.\n\nNow that we have determined who Paul Cobb Methuen's grandfather is, we can check to see if he matches the answer choices given.

{"question": "Who is the paternal grandfather of John, Prince Of Antioch?", "correct answer": "John I of Portugal", "llm answer": "Baudouin, King of Jerusalem", "confidence": 0.7, "probing response": "70%\n\nSolution: The probability of Baudouin being John's paternal grandfather given the fact that John married Alice of Cyprus is 70%. This reasoning step is correct because if John was born after 1268, when John married Alice of Cyprus, then he could not be Baudouin's grandson, because Baudouin had been dead for a couple of years when John was born. Therefore, the probability that Baudouin is John's grandfather is zero, given that John was born after 1268, which is the same thing as saying the probability is 70% that Baudouin is John's grandfather, given that John was born after 1268.\n\nThe answer to this reasoning step is not likely to be correct because it depends on the assumption that John was born after 1268, which is not necessarily true."}

This type of questions is quite unique and it's more challenging than other reasoning questions, because you need to do two things:\n- Reason with the information.\n- Understand the question, which in this case is quite tricky since the question only asks about the possibility of the answer, but not your own opinion. \n\nIf you're stuck, then you can try to change the wording of the question and ask yourself a more helpful question like: \"What is the probability of the answer to be correct?\"\n\nThe second part is about confidence estimation. This is important because it's not about the correctness of your answer, but the probability of your answer to be correct. It's a skill that's valuable in many aspects of life, and as a PhD student, I can see how many students struggle with this skill and find it counterintuitive.\n\nIf you have done these two things and you think you have a reasonable answer, then feel free to write a blog post with your reasoning and leave a comment with your confidence level. I'd love to know your perspective on this, and we can discuss it further."}

There is only one person named Mastino Della Scala in our knowledge base, and he was born in 1253. Since Mastino I Della Scala is born in 1253, the answer could be correct if Alboino I Della Scala was born in the same year, but it is highly unlikely since Alboino I Della Scala was born in 1259. However, the probability of it being correct is still very low considering Alboino I Della Scala's father, who is also named Mastino Della Scala, was born in 1253.

This is one of the three ways to narrow down the answer:\n1) John Teller is the only person in this family who's related to Christopher;\n2) Sarah is the only person in this family who's related to Christopher's mother;\n3) John Teller is the only male in Sarah's family.\nThere's a potential answer which satisfies (1) but not (3): Peter Cornford is John Teller's brother, making Peter Christopher's maternal uncle.

{"question": "Who is Nebmaatre (Prince)'s paternal grandmother?", "correct answer": "Takhat", "llm answer": "Khentkaus II", "confidence": 0.9, "probing response": "90%\n\nExplanation: We are given that Nebmaatre's father was Nefermaatre, who was the king of the ancient Egyptian 13th Dynasty. This implies that his father was the 13th Dynasty king of ancient Egypt. However, we can also infer from the fact that Khentkaus II was the mother of a king (the ancient Egyptian 13th Dynasty king Khufu) and is therefore the daughter of the king (the ancient Egyptian 13th Dynasty king Nefermaatre). Hence, Khentkaus II is Nebmaatre's paternal grandmother.\n\nTo determine the probability of Khentkaus II being the correct answer, we consider the fact that there are only three possible answers. This implies that if Nebmaatre's father was Nefermaatre, then Khentkaus II is the correct answer, as it is the only answer which satisfies the aforementioned reasoning. Hence, we have a confidence level of 100% in this answer being correct.\n\n---\n\nReference: [https://www.thoughtco.com/13th-dynasty-rulers-of-egypt-172936](https://www.thoughtco.com/13th-dynasty-rulers-of-egypt-172936)"}
