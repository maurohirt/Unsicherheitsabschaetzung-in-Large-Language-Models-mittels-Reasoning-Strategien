How many cups of coffee did Sandra and Marcie take in total?", "correct answer": 8.0, "llm answer": "8", "confidence": 1.0, "probing response": "100%\nExplanation: First, to get the correct answer, we can use the simple addition formula. Since Sandra took six cups of coffee and Marcie took two cups of coffee, Sandra and Marcie took a total of 6 + 2 cups of coffee. 6 + 2 = 8, so Sandra and Marcie took a total of 8 cups of coffee.\nSecond, if we focus on the keywords provided, Sandra and Marcie are the only two entities involved, so the number of cups of coffee that Sandra and Marcie took in total must be equal to the sum of the number of cups of coffee that Sandra and Marcie took separately. The question provides the number of cups of coffee that Sandra and Marcie took separately, so the number of cups of coffee that Sandra and Marcie took in total is the sum of the number of cups of coffee that Sandra and Marcie took separately, which is the correct answer.\nNote that Sandra and Marcie taking a total of eight cups of coffee is only the conclusion that we draw based on the keywords provided, while Sandra and Marcie actually taking a total of eight cups of coffee is the assumption that we make.\nThird, based on the first and second reasoning, the number of cups of coffee that"}
