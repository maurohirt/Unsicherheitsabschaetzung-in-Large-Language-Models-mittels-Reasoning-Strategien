The difference is equal to the new number of stickers y minus the original number of stickers x. This gives y - x = 18 - x.\nStep 4: Solve the equation for x. We get y - x = 18 - x. Simplifying the left-hand side gives y - y = 18 - x, and subtracting y from both sides gives x = 18 - y.\nStep 5: Substitute the number of Cindy's stickers for y in the final expression for x, and compute the difference. The number of stickers that Cindy had is 15, and 18 - 15 = 3.\nFinal Answer: Dan had 3 more stickers than Cindy.", "llm answer": "Dan had 3 more stickers than Cindy.", "llm answer token probability": {"Dan had 3 more stickers than Cindy.": [0.16451644897460938, 0.7981867790222168, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3095940053462982]}, "step-wise keywords": "Step 2: 18 (/5/)\nStep 3: 18 - x (/10/); y - x (/10/);\nStep 4: x (/10/);\nStep 5: 18 - y (/10/)\nStep 2: 18 (/5/)\nStep 3: 18 - x (/10/); y - x (/10/);\nStep 4: x (/10/);\nStep 5: 18 - y (/10/)", "keyword token probability": {"Step 1": {}, "Step 2": {}, "Step 3": {"x": [1.0]}, "Step 4": {"18 - y": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8807970285415649, 1.0]}, "Step 5": {"18": [0.026949463412165642, 0.8807970285415649]}}, "keyword contribution": {"Step 1": {}, "Step 2": {}, "Step 3": {"x": 10}, "Step 4": {"18 - y": 10}, "Step 5": {"18": 5}}, "keyword token ids": {"Step 1": {}, "Step 2": {}, "Step 3": {"x": [865]}, "Step 4": {"18 - y": [220, 972, 482, 379]}, "Step 5": {"18": [220, 972]}}, "final answer token ids": {"Dan had 3 more stickers than Cindy.": [11824, 1047, 220, 18, 810, 50396, 1109, 70431, 627]}}

Issa walked the remaining 3200 m, so we have 3200 m.\nStep 3: Add the distance jogged and the distance walked to get Issa's total distance traveled. We have 2133.333... + 3200 = 5333.333... m.

Because the school trained the same number of dogs and cats, the total number of animals is twice the number of dogs, which is 18 × 2 = 36.  \nStep 2: Compute the total number of cats. Since the school trains cats in groups of 3, the number of cats is the total number of animals divided by 3, which is 36 ÷ 3 = 12.  \nStep 3: Determine the smallest possible number of cats the school could have had. Because the school cannot train fractions of dogs or cats, the total number of animals must be a multiple of 18 and 3. The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 3 is 36. Therefore, the smallest number of cats the school could have had is 12.  \nStep 4: Verify the final answer. Since the school can train 18 dogs and 12 cats at once, it can train 18 × 2 + 12 × 2 = 36 dogs and cats in one session.

Find the number.", "correct answer": 96.0, "llm response": "Step 1: First, calculate the possible values of digits. The digit values can be determined by using the formula x + y = 15 where x is one digit and y is the other digit. By solving this equation, we get two possible cases: (10, 5) and (7, 8).\nStep 2: Now, we can use the given information to eliminate one of these cases. As the sum of the digits is decreased by 27, it means the number is 27 smaller than its original value. So, we can calculate the sum of the digits in the decreased number by subtracting 27 from 15. Therefore, the sum of the digits in the decreased number is 15 – 27 = –12.\nStep 3: The digits in the decreased number are reversed. Therefore, we need to swap the digits x and y. The two possible cases for the swapped digits are (5, 10) and (8, 7). However, since the sum of the digits in the decreased number is negative, the swapped digits (5, 10) do not satisfy the condition, and (8, 7) does.

So, the minimum value for r is 20/13.\nFinal Answer: The minimum number of flyers Tayli can distribute is 20/13.", "llm answer": "The minimum number of flyers Tayli can distribute is 20/13.", "llm answer token probability": {"The minimum number of flyers Tayli can distribute is 20/13.": [0.22270014882087708, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.622459352016449, 0.21938367187976837, 1.0, 0.08948525041341782, 0.8670357465744019, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.10368740558624268]}, "step-wise keywords": "Step 1: 13r + 20b (/9/)\nStep 2: 13r = 20b (/7/)\nStep 3: r = 20b/13 (/9/)\nStep 4: 20/13 (/9/)", "keyword token probability": {"Step 1": {"13r + 20b": [0.12138503044843674, 1.0, 0.07030054181814194, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]}, "Step 2": {"13r = 20b": [0.09106457233428955, 1.0, 1.0, 0.6791787147521973, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]}, "Step 3": {"r = 20b/13": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.604454517364502, 1.0]}, "Step 4": {"20/13": [0.7772998809814453, 0.4073334336280823, 0.6714555621147156, 1.0]}}, "keyword contribution": {"Step 1": {"13r + 20b": 9}, "Step 2": {"13r = 20b": 7}, "Step 3": {"r = 20b/13": 9}, "Step 4": {"20/13": 9}}, "keyword token ids": {"Step 1": {"13r + 20b": [220, 1032, 81, 489, 220, 508, 65]}, "Step 2": {"13r = 20b": [220, 1032, 81, 284, 220, 508, 65]}, "Step 3": {"r = 20b/13": [436, 284, 220, 508, 65, 14, 1032]}, "Step 4": {"20/13": [220, 508, 14, 1032]}}, "final answer token ids": {"The minimum number of flyers Tayli can distribute is 20/13.": [578, 8187, 1396, 315, 86108, 58628, 747, 649, 16822, 374, 220, 508, 14, 1032, 382]}}
